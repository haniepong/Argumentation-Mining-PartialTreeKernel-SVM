Should students be taught to compete or to cooperate?

It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.
First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.
On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.
Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.<ARG0> Pierre Vinken , 61 years old , </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <join.01>join</join.01> <ARG1> the board </ARG1> <ARGM-PRD> as a nonexecutive director </ARGM-PRD> <ARGM-TMP> Nov. 29 </ARGM-TMP> .
Mr. Vinken is chairman of Elsevier N.V. , the Dutch <publish.01>publishing</publish.01> <ARG0> group </ARG0> .

The asbestos fiber , crocidolite , is unusually resilient once <ARG0> it </ARG0> <enter.01>enters</enter.01> <ARG1> the lungs </ARG1> , with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later , researchers said .
Lorillard Inc. , <ARG0> the unit of New York-based Loews Corp. that </ARG0> <make.01>makes</make.01> <ARG1> Kent cigarettes </ARG1> , stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956 .
Although <ARG1> preliminary findings </ARG1> were <report.01>reported</report.01> <ARGM-TMP> more than a year ago </ARGM-TMP> , the latest results appear in today 's New England Journal of Medicine , a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem .
<ARG0> A Lorillard spokewoman </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> , `` <ARG1> This is an old story </ARG1> .
<ARG0> We </ARG0> 're <talk.01>talking</talk.01> <ARG1-about> about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties </ARG1-about> .
Neither Lorillard nor <ARG0> the researchers who </ARG0> <study.01>studied</study.01> <ARG1> the workers </ARG1> were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes .
`` <ARG0> We </ARG0> <have.03>have</have.03> <ARG1> no useful information on whether users are at risk </ARG1> , '' said James A. Talcott of Boston 's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute .
<ARG0> Dr. Talcott </ARG0> <lead.02>led</lead.02> <ARG1> a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The Lorillard spokeswoman </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> asbestos was used in `` very modest amounts '' in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956 .
From 1953 to 1955 , <ARG1> 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters </ARG1> were <sell.01>sold</sell.01> , the company said .
Among <ARG0> 33 men who </ARG0> <work.01>worked</work.01> <ARGM-MNR> closely </ARGM-MNR> <ARG1-with> with the substance </ARG1-with> , 28 have died -- more than three times the expected number .
Four of the five <survive.01>surviving</survive.01> <ARG0> workers </ARG0> have asbestos-related diseases , including three with recently diagnosed cancer .
<ARG1> <ARG0> The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma , lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than <expect.01>expected</expect.01> , the researchers said . </ARG0> </ARG1>
`` The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who <study.01>study</study.01> <ARG1> asbestos-related diseases </ARG1> , '' said Dr. Talcott .
The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton , Mass. , paper factory <appear.02>appears</appear.02> to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in Western industrialized countries , he said .
The plant , which is <own.01>owned</own.01> <ARG0-by> by Hollingsworth & Vose Co. </ARG0-by> , was under contract with Lorillard to make the cigarette filters .
<ARG0> The finding </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> probably </ARGM-ADV> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <support.01>support</support.01> <ARG1> those who argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos , chrysotile , found in most schools and other buildings </ARG1> , Dr. Talcott said .
The U.S. is one of the few <industrialize.01>industrialized</industrialize.01> <ARG1> nations </ARG1> that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth , needle-like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles , according to Brooke T. Mossman , a professor of pathlogy at the University of Vermont College of Medicine .
<ARG1> More common chrysotile fibers </ARG1> are curly and are <ARGM-MNR> more easily </ARGM-MNR> <reject.01>rejected</reject.01> <ARG0-by> by the body </ARG0-by> , Dr. Mossman explained .
<ARGM-TMP> In July </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> the Environmental Protection Agency </ARG0> <impose.01>imposed</impose.01> <ARG1> a gradual ban </ARG1> <ARG2-on> on virtually all uses of asbestos </ARG2-on> .
By 1997 , almost all <remain.01>remaining</remain.01> <ARG1> uses </ARG1> of cancer-causing asbestos will be outlawed .
About 160 workers at <ARG0> a factory that </ARG0> <make.01>made</make.01> <ARG1> paper for the Kent filters </ARG1> were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s .
Areas of the factory were particularly dusty <ARGM-LOC> where </ARGM-LOC> <ARG1> the crocidolite </ARG1> was <use.01>used</use.01> .
<ARG0> Workers </ARG0> <dump.01>dumped</dump.01> <ARG1> large burlap sacks of the imported material </ARG1> <ARGM-DIR> into a huge bin </ARGM-DIR> , poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters .
<ARG0> Workers </ARG0> <describe.01>described</describe.01> <ARG1> `` clouds of blue dust '' that hung over parts of the factory , even though exhaust fans ventilated the area </ARG1> .
`` There 's no question that <ARG1> some of those workers and managers </ARG1> <contract.04>contracted</contract.04> <ARG2> asbestos-related diseases </ARG2> , '' said Darrell Phillips , vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth & Vose .
`` <ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> you <have.02>have</have.02> to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago .
<ARG0> It </ARG0> <have.03>has</have.03> <ARG1> no bearing on our work force today </ARG1> .
Yields on money-market mutual funds <continue.01>continued</continue.01> to slide , <ARGM-MNR> amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates </ARGM-MNR> .
The average seven-day compound yield of <ARG1> the 400 taxable funds </ARG1> <track.01>tracked</track.01> <ARG0-by> by IBC 's Money Fund Report </ARG0-by> eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45 % from 8.47 % for the week ended Tuesday .

<ARG1> Average maturity of the funds ' investments </ARG1> <lengthen.01>lengthened</lengthen.01> <ARG2-by> by a day </ARG2-by> <ARG4-to> to 41 days , the longest since early August , </ARG4-to> according to Donoghue 's .
Longer maturities are <think.01>thought</think.01> to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period .
<ARG1> Shorter maturities </ARG1> are <consider.01>considered</consider.01> <ARG2> a sign of rising rates </ARG2> <ARGM-CAU> because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner </ARGM-CAU> .
<ARG1> The average maturity for funds open only to institutions </ARG1> , <consider.01>considered</consider.01> <ARG0-by> by some </ARG0-by> <ARG2> to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely </ARG2> , reached a high point for the year -- 33 days .
Nevertheless , <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG0> Brenda Malizia Negus , editor of Money Fund Report </ARG0> , yields `` may blip up again before they blip down '' because of recent rises in short-term interest rates .
The yield on <ARG1> six-month Treasury bills </ARG1> <sell.01>sold</sell.01> <ARGM-LOC> at Monday 's auction </ARGM-LOC> , for example , rose to 8.04 % from 7.90 % .

<ARGM-TMP> Typically </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> money-fund yields </ARG0> <beat.03>beat</beat.03> <ARG1> comparable short-term investments </ARG1> <ARGM-CAU> because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates </ARGM-CAU> .

South Korea 's economic boom , which <begin.01>began</begin.01> <ARGM-TMP> in 1986 </ARGM-TMP> , stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes , trade conflicts and sluggish exports .
<ARG0> Government officials </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $ 68 billion .
<ARGM-ADV> Despite the gloomy forecast </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> South Korea </ARG0> has <record.01>recorded</record.01> <ARG1> a trade surplus of $ 71 million </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> so far </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-TMP> this year </ARGM-TMP> .

<ARG0> Newsweek </ARG0> , <try.01>trying</try.01> <ARG1> to keep pace with rival Time magazine </ARG1> , announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers .
The new ad plan from Newsweek , a unit of the Washington Post Co. , is the second incentive plan <ARG0> the magazine </ARG0> has <offer.01>offered</offer.01> <ARG3> advertisers </ARG3> <ARGM-TMP> in three years </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> Plans that </ARG0> <give.01>give</give.01> <ARG2> advertisers </ARG2> <ARG1> discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending </ARG1> have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between Newsweek , Time Warner Inc.

<ARG1> Alan Spoon </ARG1> , <ARGM-TMP> recently </ARGM-TMP> <name.01>named</name.01> <ARG2> Newsweek president </ARG2> , said Newsweek 's ad rates would increase 5 % in January .
<ARG1> A full , four-color page in Newsweek </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <cost.01>cost</cost.01> <ARG2> $ 100,980 </ARG2> .
<ARGM-TMP> In mid-October </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Time magazine </ARG0> <lower.01>lowered</lower.01> <ARG1> its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> while not increasing ad page rates </ARGM-TMP> ; with a lower circulation base , Time 's ad rate will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber ; a full page in Time costs about $ 120,000 .
<ARG0> U.S. News </ARG0> has <ARGM-TMP> yet </ARGM-TMP> to <announce.01>announce</announce.01> <ARG1> its 1990 ad rates </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Newsweek </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it will introduce the Circulation Credit Plan , which awards space credits to advertisers on `` renewal advertising . ''
<ARG0> The magazine </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <reward.01>reward</reward.01> <ARGM-MNR> with `` page bonuses '' </ARGM-MNR> <ARG1> advertisers who in 1990 meet or exceed their 1989 spending </ARG1> , <ARGM-TMP> as long as they spent $ 325,000 in 1989 and $ 340,000 in 1990 </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> Mr. Spoon </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the plan is not an attempt to shore up a decline in ad pages in the first nine months of 1989 ; Newsweek 's ad pages totaled 1,620 , a drop of 3.2 % from last year , according to Publishers Information Bureau .
`` What <matter.01>matters</matter.01> is what advertisers are paying per page , and in that department we are doing fine this fall , '' said Mr. Spoon .
<ARG0> Both Newsweek and U.S. News </ARG0> have been <gain.02>gaining</gain.02> <ARG1> circulation </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> in recent years </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-MNR> without heavy use of electronic giveaways to subscribers , such as telephones or watches </ARGM-MNR> .

<ARGM-ADV> According to Audit Bureau of Circulations </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> Time , the largest newsweekly , </ARG0> <have.03>had</have.03> <ARG1> average circulation of 4,393,237 , a decrease of 7.3 % </ARG1> .
<ARG0> New England Electric System </ARG0> <bow.06>bowed</bow.06> out <ARG1-of> of the bidding for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire </ARG1-of> , <ARGM-ADV> saying that the risks were too high and the potential payoff too far in the future to justify a higher offer </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> The move </ARG0> <leave.01>leaves</leave.01> <ARG1> United Illuminating Co. and Northeast Utilities </ARG1> <ARG2-as> as the remaining outside bidders for PS of New Hampshire , which also has proposed an internal reorganization plan in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings under which it would remain an independent company </ARG2-as> .
<ARG1> New England Electric </ARG1> , <base.01>based</base.01> <ARGM-LOC> in Westborough , Mass. </ARGM-LOC> , had offered $ 2 billion to acquire PS of New Hampshire , well below the $ 2.29 billion value United Illuminating places on its bid and the $ 2.25 billion Northeast says its bid is worth .
<ARG1> United Illuminating </ARG1> is <base.01>based</base.01> <ARGM-LOC> in New Haven , Conn. , </ARGM-LOC> and Northeast is based in Hartford , Conn .
<ARG0> PS of New Hampshire , Manchester , N.H. , </ARG0> <value.01>values</value.01> <ARG1> its internal reorganization plan </ARG1> <ARG2-at> at about $ 2.2 billion </ARG2-at> .
<ARG0> John Rowe , president and chief executive officer of New England Electric , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the company 's return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related to PS of New Hampshire -- such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating efficiencies -- did n't come true .
`` <ARGM-TMP> When </ARGM-TMP> <ARG0> we </ARG0> <evaluate.01>evaluated</evaluate.01> <ARG1> raising our bid </ARG1> , the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years , and the rewards seemed a long way out .
<ARG1> That </ARG1> <get.03>got</get.03> hard to take , '' he added .
<ARG0> Mr. Rowe </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <note.XX>noted</note.XX> <ARG1> that political concerns also worried New England Electric </ARG1> .
No matter <ARG0> who </ARG0> <own.01>owns</own.01> <ARG1> PS of New Hampshire </ARG1> , after it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings its rates will be among the highest in the nation , he said .
`` <ARG0> That </ARG0> <attract.01>attracts</attract.01> <ARG1> attention </ARG1> ...
it was just another one of the risk factors '' that <lead.03>led</lead.03> <ARG2-to> to the company 's decision to withdraw from the bidding </ARG2-to> , he added .
<ARG0> Wilbur Ross Jr. of Rothschild Inc. , the financial adviser to the troubled company 's equity holders </ARG0> , <say.01>said</say.01> the withdrawal of New England Electric might speed up the reorganization process .
The fact that <ARG0> New England </ARG0> <propose.01>proposed</propose.01> <ARG1> lower rate increases -- 4.8 % over seven years against around 5.5 % boosts proposed by the other two outside bidders -- </ARG1> complicated negotiations with state officials , Mr. Ross asserted .
`` <ARGM-TMP> Now </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> the field </ARG1> is <ARGM-EXT> less </ARGM-EXT> <clutter.01>cluttered</clutter.01> , '' he added .

<ARG0> Northeast </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it would refile its request and still hopes for an expedited review by the FERC so that it could complete the purchase by next summer if its bid is the one approved by the bankruptcy court .

<ARG1> Commonwealth Edison Co. </ARG1> was <order.01>ordered</order.01> <ARG2> to refund about $ 250 million to its current and former ratepayers for illegal rates collected for cost overruns on a nuclear power plant </ARG2> .
<ARG1> The refund was about $ 55 million more than <ARGM-TMP> previously </ARGM-TMP> <order.01>ordered</order.01> <ARG0-by> by the Illinois Commerce Commission </ARG0-by> and trade groups said it may be the largest ever required of a state or local utility . </ARG1>
<ARG0> State court Judge Richard Curry </ARG0> <order.01>ordered</order.01> <ARG1> Edison </ARG1> <ARG2> to make average refunds of about $ 45 to $ 50 each to Edison customers who have received electric service since April 1986 , including about two million customers who have moved during that period </ARG2> .
<ARG0> Judge Curry </ARG0> <order.01>ordered</order.01> <ARG1> the refunds </ARG1> <ARG2> to begin Feb. 1 </ARG2> and said that he would n't entertain any appeals or other attempts to block his order by Commonwealth Edison .
`` <ARG1> The refund pool </ARG1> ... <ARGM-MOD> may </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> be <hold.02>held</hold.02> <ARG2> hostage </ARG2> <ARGM-TMP> through another round of appeals </ARGM-TMP> , '' Judge Curry said .
<ARG0> Commonwealth Edison </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it is already appealing the underlying commission order and is considering appealing Judge Curry 's order .
<ARG1> The exact amount of the refund </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> be <determine.01>determined</determine.01> <ARGM-TMP> next year </ARGM-TMP> <ARG2> based on actual collections made until Dec. 31 of this year </ARG2> .
<ARG0> Commonwealth Edison </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the ruling could force it to slash its 1989 earnings by $ 1.55 a share .
<ARGM-TMP> For 1988 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Commonwealth Edison </ARG0> <report.01>reported</report.01> <ARG1> earnings of $ 737.5 million , or $ 3.01 a share </ARG1> .
<ARG0> A Commonwealth Edison spokesman </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that tracking down the two million customers whose addresses have changed during the past 3 1\/2 years would be `` an administrative nightmare </ARG1> . ''
<ARGM-LOC> In New York Stock Exchange composite trading </ARGM-LOC> <ARGM-TMP> yesterday </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> Commonwealth Edison </ARG1> <close.02>closed</close.02> <ARGM-EXT> at $ 38.375 </ARGM-EXT> , <ARGM-MNR> down 12.5 cents </ARGM-MNR> .
<ARG1> The $ 2.5 billion Byron 1 plant near Rockford , Ill. , </ARG1> was <complete.01>completed</complete.01> <ARGM-TMP> in 1985 </ARGM-TMP> .
In a <dispute.01>disputed</dispute.01> <ARG2> 1985 ruling </ARG2> , the Commerce Commission said Commonwealth Edison could raise its electricity rates by $ 49 million to pay for the plant .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> state courts </ARG0> <uphold.01>upheld</uphold.01> <ARG1> a challenge by consumer groups to the commission 's rate increase </ARG1> and found the rates illegal .
<ARG0> The Illinois Supreme Court </ARG0> <order.01>ordered</order.01> <ARG2> the commission </ARG2> <ARG1> to audit Commonwealth Edison 's construction expenses and refund any unreasonable expenses </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The utility </ARG0> has been <collect.01>collecting</collect.01> <ARG4-for> for the plant 's construction cost </ARG4-for> <ARG2-from> from its 3.1 million customers subject to a refund </ARG2-from> <ARGM-TMP> since 1986 </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARGM-TMP> In August </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> the commission </ARG0> <rule.01>ruled</rule.01> <ARG1> that between $ 190 million and $ 195 million of the plant 's construction cost was unreasonable and should be refunded , plus interest </ARG1> .
<ARGM-LOC> In his ruling </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> Judge Curry </ARG0> <add.02>added</add.02> <ARG1> an additional $ 55 million </ARG1> <ARG2-to> to the commission 's calculations </ARG2-to> .
<ARGM-TMP> Last month </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Judge Curry </ARG0> <set.01>set</set.01> <ARG1> the interest rate on the refund </ARG1> <ARG2-at> at 9 % </ARG2-at> .
<ARG0> Commonwealth Edison </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> now </ARGM-TMP> <face.01>faces</face.01> <ARG1> an additional court-ordered refund on its summer\/winter rate differential collections that the Illinois Appellate Court has estimated at $ 140 million </ARG1> .
And <ARG0> consumer groups </ARG0> <hope.01>hope</hope.01> <ARG1> that Judge Curry 's Byron 1 order may set a precedent for a second nuclear rate case involving Commonwealth Edison 's Braidwood 2 plant </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Commonwealth Edison </ARG0> is <seek.01>seeking</seek.01> about $ 245 million in rate increases to pay for Braidwood 2 .
The commission is <expect.01>expected</expect.01> to rule on the Braidwood 2 case by year end .
Last year Commonwealth Edison <have.02>had</have.02> to refund $ 72.7 million for poor performance of its LaSalle I nuclear plant .
<ARG1> Japan 's domestic sales of cars , trucks and buses in October </ARG1> <rise.01>rose</rise.01> <ARG2-EXT> 18 % </ARG2-EXT> <ARG3-from> from a year earlier </ARG3-from> <ARG4-to> to 500,004 units , a record for the month </ARG4-to> , the Japan Automobile Dealers ' Association said .
<ARG1> The strong growth </ARG1> <follow.01>followed</follow.01> <ARG2> year-to-year increases of 21 % in August and 12 % in September </ARG2> .
<ARG0> The monthly sales </ARG0> have been <set.02>setting</set.02> <ARG1> records </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> every month since March </ARGM-TMP> .

Sales of medium-sized cars , which <benefit.01>benefited</benefit.01> <ARG0-from> from price reductions arising from introduction of the consumption tax </ARG0-from> , more than doubled to 30,841 units from 13,056 in October 1988 .
<ARG0> Texas Instruments Japan Ltd. , a unit of Texas Instruments Inc. , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it opened a plant in South Korea to manufacture control devices .
<ARG1> The new plant </ARG1> , <locate.01>located</locate.01> <ARGM-LOC> in Chinchon about 60 miles from Seoul </ARGM-LOC> , will help meet increasing and diversifying demand for control products in South Korea , the company said .
<ARG0> The plant </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <produce.01>produce</produce.01> <ARG1> control devices used in motor vehicles and household appliances </ARG1> .
The survival of spinoff Cray Computer Corp. as a fledgling in the supercomputer business <appear.02>appears</appear.02> to depend heavily on the creativity -- and longevity -- of its chairman and chief designer , Seymour Cray .
Not only is <ARG1> development of the new company 's initial machine </ARG1> <tie.01>tied</tie.01> <ARGM-MNR> directly </ARGM-MNR> <ARG1-to> to Mr. Cray </ARG1-to> , so is its balance sheet .
<ARG1> Documents </ARG1> <file.01>filed</file.01> <ARG2-with> with the Securities and Exchange Commission </ARG2-with> <ARGM-MNR> on the pending spinoff </ARGM-MNR> disclosed that Cray Research Inc. will withdraw the almost $ 100 million in financing it is providing the new firm if Mr. Cray leaves or if the product-design project he heads is scrapped .
<ARG0> The documents </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that although the 64-year-old Mr. Cray has been working on the project for more than six years , the Cray-3 machine is at least another year away from a fully operational prototype </ARG1> .
Moreover , there have been no orders for the Cray-3 so far , though <ARG0> the company </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> it is talking with several prospects .
While <ARG1> many of the risks </ARG1> were <anticipate.01>anticipated</anticipate.01> <ARGM-TMP> when Minneapolis-based Cray Research first announced the spinoff in May </ARGM-TMP> , the strings it attached to the financing had n't been made public until yesterday .
`` <ARG0> We </ARG0> did <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <have.03>have</have.03> <ARG1> much of a choice </ARG1> , '' Cray Computer 's chief financial officer , Gregory Barnum , said in an interview .
`` The theory is that Seymour is the chief designer of the Cray-3 , and <ARGM-ADV> without him </ARGM-ADV> <ARG1> it </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> be <complete.01>completed</complete.01> .
<ARG0> Cray Research </ARG0> did <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> <want.01>want</want.01> <ARG1> to fund a project that did not include Seymour </ARG1> . ''
<ARG0> The documents </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that Cray Computer anticipates needing perhaps another $ 120 million in financing beginning next September </ARG1> .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> Mr. Barnum </ARG0> <call.01>called</call.01> <ARG1> that </ARG1> <ARG2> `` a worst-case '' scenario </ARG2> .
<ARG0> The filing on the details of the spinoff </ARG0> <cause.01>caused</cause.01> <ARG1> Cray Research stock to jump $ 2.875 yesterday to close at $ 38 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Analysts </ARG0> <note.XX>noted</note.XX> <ARGM-TMP> yesterday </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> that Cray Research 's decision to link its $ 98.3 million promissory note to Mr. Cray 's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company </ARG1> .
`` It <have.02>has</have.02> to be considered as an additional risk for the investor , '' said Gary P. Smaby of Smaby Group Inc. , Minneapolis .
`` <ARG1> Cray Computer will be a concept stock </ARG1> , '' <ARG0> he </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> .
`` <ARG0> You </ARG0> either <believe.01>believe</believe.01> Seymour can do it again or you do n't . ''
<ARGM-ADV> Besides the designer 's age </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG2> other risk factors for Mr. Cray 's new company </ARG2> <include.01>include</include.01> <ARG1> the Cray-3 's tricky , unproven chip technology </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The SEC documents </ARG0> <describe.01>describe</describe.01> <ARG1> those chips , which are made of gallium arsenide , </ARG1> as being so fragile and minute they will require special robotic handling equipment .
<ARGM-DIS> In addition </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> the Cray-3 </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <contain.01>contain</contain.01> <ARG1> 16 processors -- twice as many as the largest current supercomputer </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Cray Computer </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <face.01>face</face.01> <ARG1> intense competition , not only from Cray Research , which has about 60 % of the world-wide supercomputer market and which is expected to roll out the C-90 machine , a direct competitor with the Cray-3 , in 1991 </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The spinoff </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <compete.01>compete</compete.01> <ARG1-with> with International Business Machines Corp. and Japan 's Big Three -- Hitachi Ltd. , NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd </ARG1-with> .
<ARG0> The new company </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it believes there are fewer than 100 potential customers for supercomputers priced between $ 15 million and $ 30 million -- presumably the Cray-3 price range .
Under terms of the spinoff , <ARG0> Cray Research stockholders </ARG0> are to <receive.01>receive</receive.01> <ARG1> one Cray Computer share </ARG1> for every two Cray Research shares they own <ARGM-LOC> in a distribution expected to occur in about two weeks </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG1> No price for the new shares </ARG1> has been <set.01>set</set.01> .
<ARGM-DIS> Instead </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> the companies </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <leave.01>leave</leave.01> <ARG2> it </ARG2> <ARG1-up> up to the marketplace </ARG1-up> to decide .
<ARG0> Cray Computer </ARG0> has <apply.01>applied</apply.01> <ARG1> to trade on Nasdaq </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Analysts </ARG0> <calculate.01>calculate</calculate.01> <ARG1> Cray Computer 's initial book value </ARG1> <ARG2-at> at about $ 4.75 a share </ARG2-at> .
<ARGM-ADV> Along with the note </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> Cray Research </ARG0> is <transfer.01>transferring</transfer.01> <ARG1> about $ 53 million in assets , primarily those related to the Cray-3 development , which has been a drain on Cray Research 's earnings </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Pro-forma balance sheets </ARG0> <ARGM-MNR> clearly </ARGM-MNR> <show.01>show</show.01> <ARG1> why Cray Research favored the spinoff </ARG1> .
Without the Cray-3 research and development expenses , <ARG0> the company </ARG0> would have been able to <report.01>report</report.01> a profit of $ 19.3 million for the first half of 1989 rather than the $ 5.9 million it posted .
On the other hand , had <ARG1> it </ARG1> <exist.01>existed</exist.01> <ARGM-TMP> then </ARGM-TMP> , Cray Computer would have incurred a $ 20.5 million loss .
Mr. Cray , who <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> be <reach.02>reached</reach.02> <ARGM-PNC> for comment </ARGM-PNC> , will work for the new Colorado Springs , Colo. , company as an independent contractor -- the arrangement he had with Cray Research .
<regard.01>Regarded</regard.01> <ARG2-as> as the father of the supercomputer </ARG2-as> , <ARG1> Mr. </ARG1> Cray was paid $ 600,000 at Cray Research last year .
<ARGM-LOC> At Cray Computer </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG2> he </ARG2> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> be <pay.01>paid</pay.01> <ARG1> $ 240,000 </ARG1> .
<ARGM-ADV> Besides Messrs.

Cray Computer , which <ARGM-TMP> currently </ARGM-TMP> <employ.01>employs</employ.01> <ARG1> 241 people </ARG1> , said it expects a work force of 450 by the end of 1990 .
<ARG1> John R. Stevens , 49 years old , </ARG1> was <name.01>named</name.01> <ARG2> senior executive vice president and chief operating officer , both new positions </ARG2> .

<ARG0> The U.S. </ARG0> , <claim.01>claiming</claim.01> <ARG1> some success in its trade diplomacy </ARG1> , removed South Korea , Taiwan and Saudi Arabia from a list of countries it is closely watching for allegedly failing to honor U.S. patents , copyrights and other intellectual-property rights .
<ARGM-DIS> However </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG1> five other countries -- China , Thailand , India , Brazil and Mexico -- </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <remain.01>remain</remain.01> <ARG3-on> on that so-called priority watch list </ARG3-on> <ARGM-CAU> as a result of an interim review </ARGM-CAU> , U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills announced .
<ARGM-LOC> Under the new U.S. trade law </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> those countries </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <face.01>face</face.01> <ARG1> accelerated unfair-trade investigations and stiff trade sanctions </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> if they do n't improve their protection of intellectual property by next spring </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> Mrs. Hills </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> many of the 25 countries that she placed under varying degrees of scrutiny have made `` genuine progress '' on this touchy issue .
<ARG0> She </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> there is `` growing realization '' around the world that denial of intellectual-property rights harms all trading nations , and particularly the `` creativity and inventiveness of an -LCB- offending -RCB- country 's own citizens . ''
<ARG0> U.S. trade negotiators </ARG0> <argue.01>argue</argue.01> <ARG1> that countries with inadequate protections for intellectual-property rights could be hurting themselves by discouraging their own scientists and authors and by deterring U.S. high-technology firms from investing or marketing their best products there </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Mrs. Hills </ARG0> <laud.01>lauded</laud.01> <ARG1> South Korea </ARG1> <ARG2-for> for creating an intellectual-property task force and special enforcement teams of police officers and prosecutors trained to pursue movie and book pirates </ARG2-for> .
<ARG0> Seoul </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> has <institute.01>instituted</institute.01> effective search-and-seizure procedures to aid these teams , she said .
<ARG0> Taiwan </ARG0> has <improve.01>improved</improve.01> <ARG1> its standing with the U.S. </ARG1> by initialing a bilateral copyright agreement , amending its trademark law and introducing legislation to protect foreign movie producers from unauthorized showings of their films .
<ARG0> That measure </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <compel.01>compel</compel.01> <ARG1> Taipei 's growing number of small video-viewing parlors </ARG1> <ARG2> to pay movie producers for showing their films </ARG2> .
<ARG0> Saudi Arabia </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> , for its part , </ARGM-DIS> has <vow.01>vowed</vow.01> <ARG1> to enact a copyright law compatible with international standards and to apply the law to computer software as well as to literary works </ARG1> , Mrs. Hills said .
<ARG1> They </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <remain.01>remain</remain.01> <ARG3-on> on a lower-priority list that includes 17 other countries </ARG3-on> .
<ARG1> Those countries -- including Japan , Italy , Canada , Greece and Spain -- </ARG1> are still of some concern to the U.S. but are <deem.01>deemed</deem.01> <ARG2> to pose less-serious problems for American patent and copyright owners than those on the `` priority '' list </ARG2> .
Gary Hoffman , <ARG0> a Washington lawyer </ARG0> <specialize.01>specializing</specialize.01> <ARG1-in> in intellectual-property cases </ARG1-in> , said the threat of U.S. retaliation , combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country 's own interest , prompted the improvements made by South Korea , Taiwan and Saudi Arabia .
`` <ARG1> What </ARG1> <ARG0> this </ARG0> <tell.01>tells</tell.01> <ARG2> us </ARG2> is that U.S. trade law is working , '' he said .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> Mexico could be one of the next countries to be removed from the priority list because of its efforts to craft a new patent law .
<ARG0> Mrs. Hills </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that the U.S. is still concerned about `` disturbing developments in Turkey and continuing slow progress in Malaysia </ARG1> . ''
She did n't elaborate , although <ARG0> earlier U.S. trade reports </ARG0> have <complain.01>complained</complain.01> <ARG1-of> of videocassette piracy in Malaysia and disregard for U.S. pharmaceutical patents in Turkey </ARG1-of> .
<ARG0> The 1988 trade act </ARG0> <require.01>requires</require.01> <ARG2> Mrs. Hills </ARG2> <ARG1> to issue another review of the performance of these countries by April 30 </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> So far </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Mrs. Hills </ARG0> has <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <deem.01>deemed</deem.01> <ARG1> any cases </ARG1> <ARG2> bad enough to merit an accelerated investigation under the so-called special 301 provision of the act </ARG2> .
<ARG0> Argentina </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it will ask creditor banks to halve its foreign debt of $ 64 billion -- the third-highest in the developing world .
The declaration by Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli is <believe.01>believed</believe.01> to be the first time such an action has been called for by an Argentine official of such stature .
<ARG0> The Latin American nation </ARG0> has <pay.01>paid</pay.01> <ARG3> very little </ARG3> <ARG2-on> on its debt </ARG2-on> <ARGM-TMP> since early last year </ARGM-TMP> .
`` <ARG0> Argentina </ARG0> <aspire.01>aspires</aspire.01> <ARG1> to reach a reduction of 50 % in the value of its external debt </ARG1> , '' Mr. Rapanelli said through his spokesman , Miguel Alurralde .
<ARG0> Mr. Rapanelli </ARG0> <meet.03>met</meet.03> <ARGM-TMP> in August </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1-with> with U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford </ARG1-with> .
<ARG0> Argentine negotiator Carlos Carballo </ARG0> was in Washington and New York this week to <meet.03>meet</meet.03> <ARG1-with> with banks </ARG1-with> .
<ARG0> Mr. Rapanelli </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> recently </ARGM-TMP> has <say.01>said</say.01> the government of President Carlos Menem , who took office July 8 , feels a significant reduction of principal and interest is the only way the debt problem may be solved .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> he </ARG0> has <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARGM-TMP> before </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> that the country wants half the debt forgiven </ARG1> .

<ARG0> THREE COMPUTERS THAT </ARG0> <change.01>CHANGED</change.01> <ARG1> the face of personal computing </ARG1> were launched in 1977 .
<ARGM-TMP> That year </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> the Apple II , Commodore Pet and Tandy TRS-80 </ARG1> <come.01>came</come.01> <ARG4-to> to market </ARG4-to> .
Apple II owners , for example , <have.02>had</have.02> to use their television sets as screens and stored data on audiocassettes .
But Apple II was a major advance from Apple I , which was <build.01>built</build.01> <ARGM-LOC> in a garage </ARGM-LOC> <ARG0-by> by Stephen Wozniak and Steven Jobs </ARG0-by> <ARGM-PNC> for hobbyists such as the Homebrew Computer Club </ARGM-PNC> .
<ARGM-ADV> Crude as they were </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> these early PCs </ARG0> <trigger.01>triggered</trigger.01> <ARG1> explosive product development in desktop models for the home and office </ARG1> .

<ARG0> F.H. Faulding & Co. , an Australian pharmaceuticals company , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> its Moleculon Inc. affiliate acquired Kalipharma Inc. for $ 23 million .
Kalipharma is <ARG0> a New Jersey-based pharmaceuticals concern that </ARG0> <sell.01>sells</sell.01> <ARG1> products </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> under the Purepac label </ARGM-MNR> .
<ARG0> Faulding </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it owns 33 % of Moleculon 's voting stock and has an agreement to acquire an additional 19 % .
That stake , together with its convertible <prefer.01>preferred</prefer.01> <ARG1> stock holdings </ARG1> , gives Faulding the right to increase its interest to 70 % of Moleculon 's voting stock .

<ARG0> The White House </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> President Bush has approved duty-free treatment for imports of certain types of watches that are n't produced in `` significant quantities '' in the U.S. , the Virgin Islands and other U.S. possessions .
<ARG1> The action </ARG1> <come.01>came</come.01> <ARGM-MNR> in response to a petition filed by Timex Inc. for changes in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences for imports from developing nations </ARGM-MNR> .
<ARGM-TMP> Previously </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG2> watch imports </ARG2> were <deny.01>denied</deny.01> <ARG1> such duty-free treatment </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Timex </ARG0> had <request.01>requested</request.01> <ARG1> duty-free treatment for many types of watches , covered by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The White House </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> Mr. Bush decided to grant duty-free status for 18 categories , but turned down such treatment for other types of watches `` because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the U.S. and the Virgin Islands . ''
Timex is a major U.S. producer and seller of <ARG2> watches </ARG2> , <include.01>including</include.01> <ARG1> low-priced battery-operated watches assembled in the Philippines and other developing nations covered by the U.S. tariff preferences </ARG1> .
<ARG0> U.S. trade officials </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the Philippines and Thailand would be the main beneficiaries of the president 's action .
<ARG1> Imports of the types of watches that now will be eligible for duty-free treatment </ARG1> <total.01>totaled</total.01> <ARG2-EXT> about $ 37.3 million </ARG2-EXT> <ARGM-TMP> in 1988 </ARGM-TMP> , a relatively small share of the $ 1.5 billion in U.S. watch imports that year , according to an aide to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills .

<ARG0> They </ARG0> <expect.01>expect</expect.01> <ARG1> him to cut costs throughout the organization </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The company </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> Mr. Stronach will personally direct the restructuring , assisted by Manfred Gingl , president and chief executive .

<ARG0> The purchases </ARG0> <show.01>show</show.01> <ARG1> the strong interest of Japanese investors in U.S. mortgage-based instruments </ARG1> , Fannie Mae 's chairman , David O. Maxwell , said at a news conference .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> more than 90 % of the funds were placed with Japanese institutional investors .
<ARG1> The rest </ARG1> <go.10>went</go.10> <ARG2-to> to investors from France and Hong Kong </ARG2-to> .
<ARGM-TMP> Earlier this year </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Japanese investors </ARG0> <snap.08>snapped</snap.08> up <ARG1> a similar , $ 570 million mortgage-backed securities mutual fund </ARG1> .
<ARG1> That fund </ARG1> was <put.03>put</put.03> <ARG2> together </ARG2> <ARG0-by> by Blackstone Group , a New York investment bank </ARG0-by> .
<ARG1> The latest two funds </ARG1> were <assemble.02>assembled</assemble.02> <ARGM-ADV> jointly </ARGM-ADV> <ARG0-by> by Goldman , Sachs & Co. of the U.S. and Japan 's Daiwa Securities Co </ARG0-by> .
The new , seven-year funds -- <ARG0> one </ARG0> <offer.01>offering</offer.01> <ARG1> a fixed-rate return </ARG1> and the other with a floating-rate return linked to the London interbank offered rate -- offer two key advantages to Japanese investors .
<ARGM-DIS> First </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG1> they </ARG1> are <design.01>designed</design.01> <ARG3> to eliminate the risk of prepayment </ARG3> -- mortgage-backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline , and such prepayment forces investors to redeploy their money at lower rates .
<ARGM-DIS> Second </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> they </ARG0> <channel.01>channel</channel.01> <ARG1> monthly mortgage payments </ARG1> <ARG2-into> into semiannual payments </ARG2-into> , <ARGM-ADV> reducing the administrative burden on investors </ARGM-ADV> .
By <address.02>addressing</address.02> <ARG1> those problems </ARG1> , Mr. Maxwell said , <ARG0> the new funds </ARG0> have become `` extremely attractive to Japanese and other investors outside the U.S. . ''
<ARG0> Such devices </ARG0> have <boost.01>boosted</boost.01> <ARG1> Japanese investment in mortgage-backed securities </ARG1> <ARG4-to> to more than 1 % of the $ 900 billion in such instruments outstanding </ARG4-to> , and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate .
<ARG1> They </ARG1> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> have <become.01>become</become.01> <ARG2> large purchasers of Fannie Mae 's corporate debt </ARG2> , <ARGM-ADV> buying $ 2.4 billion in Fannie Mae bonds during the first nine months of the year , or almost a tenth of the total amount issued </ARGM-ADV> .

<ARG0> The total </ARG0> <mark.01>marks</mark.01> <ARG1> the sixth consecutive monthly decline </ARG1> .
<ARG2> The protracted downturn </ARG2> <reflect.01>reflects</reflect.01> <ARG1> the intensity of Bank of Japan yen-support intervention since June , when the U.S. currency temporarily surged above the 150.00 yen level </ARG1> .

It 's <ARG1> the latest investment craze </ARG1> <sweep.02>sweeping</sweep.02> <ARG2> Wall Street </ARG2> : a rash of new closed-end country funds , those publicly traded portfolios that invest in stocks of a single foreign country .
<ARG1> No fewer than 24 country funds </ARG1> have been <launch.01>launched</launch.01> or registered with regulators <ARGM-TMP> this year </ARGM-TMP> , triple the level of all of 1988 , according to Charles E. Simon & Co. , a Washington-based research firm .
<ARG1> The turf </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> recently </ARGM-TMP> has <range.01>ranged</range.01> <ARG3-from> from Chile </ARG3-from> to Austria <ARG4-to> to Portugal </ARG4-to> .
<ARGM-TMP> Next week </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> the Philippine Fund 's launch </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> be <cap.02>capped</cap.02> by a visit by Philippine President Corazon Aquino -- the first time a head of state has kicked off an issue at the Big Board here .
`` <ARG1> Anything 's possible -- how about the New Guinea Fund ? </ARG1> '' <quip.01>quips</quip.01> <ARG0> George Foot , a managing partner at Newgate Management Associates of Northampton , Mass </ARG0> .
<ARG2> The recent explosion of country funds </ARG2> <mirror.01>mirrors</mirror.01> the `` closed-end fund mania '' of the 1920s , Mr. Foot says , when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular .
<ARG1> They </ARG1> <fall.01>fell</fall.01> <ARG4-into> into oblivion </ARG4-into> <ARGM-TMP> after the 1929 crash </ARGM-TMP> .
Unlike traditional open-end mutual funds , most of these one-country portfolios are <ARG0> the `` closed-end '' type </ARG0> , <issue.01>issuing</issue.01> <ARG1> a fixed number of shares that trade publicly </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The surge </ARG0> <bring.01>brings</bring.01> <ARG3-to> to nearly 50 </ARG3-to> <ARG1> the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in New York or London </ARG1> .
<ARG0> These funds </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> now </ARGM-TMP> <account.01>account</account.01> <ARG1-for> for several billions of dollars in assets </ARG1-for> .
`` <ARG0> People </ARG0> are <look.04>looking</look.04> <ARG1> to stake their claims </ARG1> '' <ARGM-TMP> now </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-TMP> before the number of available nations runs out </ARGM-TMP> , says Michael Porter , an analyst at Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. , New York .
As <ARG1> individual investors </ARG1> have <turn.04>turned</turn.04> away <ARG2-from> from the stock market </ARG2-from> <ARGM-TMP> over the years </ARGM-TMP> , securities firms have scrambled to find new products that brokers find easy to sell .
<ARGM-DIS> And </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> the firms </ARG0> are <stretch.01>stretching</stretch.01> <ARG1> their nets </ARG1> <ARG2-EXT> far and wide </ARG2-EXT> <ARGM-PNC> to do it </ARGM-PNC> .
<ARG0> Financial planners </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> often </ARGM-TMP> <urge.01>urge</urge.01> <ARG1> investors </ARG1> <ARG2> to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities </ARG2> .
And many <emerge.02>emerging</emerge.02> <ARG0> markets </ARG0> have outpaced more mature markets , such as the U.S. and Japan .
<ARG0> Country funds </ARG0> <offer.01>offer</offer.01> an easy way to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> it does <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <take.10>take</take.10> <ARG1> much </ARG1> <ARG0> to get burned </ARG0> .
<ARG0> Political and currency gyrations </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <whipsaw.01>whipsaw</whipsaw.01> <ARG1> the funds </ARG1> .
Another concern : <ARG1> The funds ' share prices </ARG1> <tend.02>tend</tend.02> <ARG2> to swing more than the broader market </ARG2> .
<ARGM-TMP> When </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> the stock market </ARG1> <drop.01>dropped</drop.01> <ARG2-EXT> nearly 7 % </ARG2-EXT> <ARGM-TMP> Oct. 13 </ARGM-TMP> , for instance , the Mexico Fund plunged about 18 % and the Spain Fund fell 16 % .
And <ARG1> most country funds </ARG1> were <clobber.01>clobbered</clobber.01> <ARGM-MNR> more than most stocks </ARGM-MNR> <ARGM-TMP> after the 1987 crash </ARGM-TMP> .
What 's so wild about the funds ' frenzy right now is that <ARG1> many </ARG1> are <trade.01>trading</trade.01> <ARG3-at> at historically fat premiums </ARG3-at> <ARG4-to> to the value of their underlying portfolios </ARG4-to> .
After <trade.01>trading</trade.01> <ARG3-at> at an average discount of more than 20 % </ARG3-at> <ARGM-TMP> in late 1987 and part of last year </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> country funds </ARG1> currently trade at an average premium of 6 % .
The reason : <ARG1> Share prices of many of these funds </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> this year </ARGM-TMP> have <climb.02>climbed</climb.02> much more sharply than the foreign stocks they hold .
<ARG0> It 's probably worth <pay.01>paying</pay.01> <ARG3> a premium </ARG3> <ARG1-for> for funds that invest in markets that are partially closed to foreign investors , such as South Korea </ARG1-for> , some specialists say . </ARG0>
But <ARG1> some European funds </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> recently </ARGM-TMP> have <skyrocket.01>skyrocketed</skyrocket.01> ; Spain Fund has surged to a startling 120 % premium .
<ARG1> It </ARG1> has been <target.01>targeted</target.01> <ARG0-by> by Japanese investors </ARG0-by> as <ARGM-PRD> a good long-term play tied to 1992 's European economic integration </ARGM-PRD> .
And <ARG0> several new funds that are n't even fully invested yet </ARG0> have <jump.02>jumped</jump.02> <ARG1> to trade at big premiums </ARG1> .
`` <ARG1> I </ARG1> 'm <ARGM-MNR> very </ARGM-MNR> <alarm.01>alarmed</alarm.01> <ARG0> to see these rich valuations </ARG0> , '' says Smith Barney 's Mr. Porter .
The <ARGM-TMP> newly </ARGM-TMP> <fatten.01>fattened</fatten.01> <ARG1> premiums </ARG1> reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds , Mr. Porter suggests .
Unlike many U.S. investors , <ARG0> those in Asia or Europe </ARG0> <seek.01>seeking</seek.01> <ARG1> foreign-stock exposure </ARG1> may be less resistant to paying higher prices for country funds .
`` There may be <ARG1> an international viewpoint </ARG1> <cast.01>cast</cast.01> <ARG2-on> on the funds listed here </ARG2-on> , '' Mr. Porter says .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <argue.01>argue</argue.01> <ARG1> that U.S. investors often can buy American depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds </ARG1> ; these so-called ADRs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the U.S. .
<ARGM-MNR> That way </ARGM-MNR> <ARG0> investors </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-ADV> essentially </ARGM-ADV> <buy.01>buy</buy.01> <ARG1> the funds </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> without paying the premium </ARGM-ADV> .
For <ARG0> people who </ARG0> <insist.01>insist</insist.01> <ARG1-on> on jumping in now to buy the funds </ARG1-on> , Newgate 's Mr. Foot says : `` The only advice I have for these folks is that those who come to the party late had better be ready to leave quickly .
<ARG0> The U.S. and Soviet Union </ARG0> are <hold.04>holding</hold.04> <ARG1> technical talks about possible repayment by Moscow of $ 188 million in pre-Communist Russian debts owed to the U.S. government </ARG1> , the State Department said .
If <ARG1> the debts </ARG1> are <repay.01>repaid</repay.01> , it could clear the way for Soviet bonds to be sold in the U.S. .
<ARGM-DIS> However </ARGM-DIS> , <ARGM-TMP> after two meetings with the Soviets </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> a State Department spokesman </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that it 's `` too early to say '' whether that will happen </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> Coincident with the talks </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> the State Department </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it has permitted a Soviet bank to open a New York branch .
<ARG1> The branch of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs </ARG1> was <approve.01>approved</approve.01> <ARGM-TMP> last spring </ARGM-TMP> and opened in July .
But <ARG1> a Soviet bank here </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> be <cripple.01>crippled</cripple.01> unless Moscow found a way to settle the $ 188 million debt , which was lent to the country 's short-lived democratic Kerensky government before the Communists seized power in 1917 .
Under a 1934 law , <ARG1> the Johnson Debt Default Act </ARG1> , as <amend.01>amended</amend.01> , it 's illegal for Americans to extend credit to countries in default to the U.S. government , unless they are members of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund .
<ARG0> The U.S.S.R. </ARG0> <belong.01>belongs</belong.01> <ARG1-to> to neither organization </ARG1-to> .
<ARG0> Moscow </ARG0> has <settle.02>settled</settle.02> <ARG1> pre-1917 debts with other countries </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> in recent years </ARGM-TMP> <ARG3-at> at less than face value </ARG3-at> .
<ARG0> The State Department </ARG0> <stress.01>stressed</stress.01> <ARG1> the pre-1933 debts </ARG1> <ARG2-as> as the key to satisfying the Johnson Act </ARG2-as> .
But <ARG0> the Soviets </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> might </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-TMP> still </ARGM-TMP> <face.01>face</face.01> <ARG1> legal obstacles to raising money in the U.S. </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the World War II lend-lease program </ARGM-TMP> .
In another reflection that <ARG1> the growth of the economy </ARG1> is <level.02>leveling</level.02> off , the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in September .
<ARGM-TMP> Meanwhile </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> the National Association of Purchasing Management </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in October for the sixth consecutive month .
<ARG1> Its index </ARG1> <inch.01>inched</inch.01> <ARG5-DIR> up </ARG5-DIR> <ARG4-to> to 47.6 % in October </ARG4-to> <ARG3-from> from 46 % in September </ARG3-from> .
<ARG0> Any reading below 50 % </ARG0> <suggest.01>suggests</suggest.01> the manufacturing sector is generally declining .
The <purchase.01>purchasing</purchase.01> <ARG0> managers </ARG0> , however , also said that orders turned up in October after four months of decline .
<ARG0> Factories </ARG0> <book.01>booked</book.01> $ 236.74 billion in orders <ARGM-TMP> in September </ARGM-TMP> , nearly the same as the $ 236.79 billion in August , the Commerce Department said .
<ARGM-ADV> If not for a 59.6 % surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG1> factory orders </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> have <fall.01>fallen</fall.01> <ARG2-EXT> 2.1 % </ARG2-EXT> .
<ARGM-LOC> In a separate report </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> the department </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> construction spending ran at an annual rate of $ 415.6 billion , not significantly different from the $ 415.8 billion reported for August .
<ARG1> The figures in both reports </ARG1> were <adjust.01>adjusted</adjust.01> <ARGM-PNC> to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns </ARGM-PNC> , but were n't adjusted for inflation .
<ARG0> Kenneth Mayland , economist for Society Corp. , a Cleveland bank , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to taper off .
<ARGM-TMP> At the same time </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> the drop in interest rates since the spring </ARG1> has <fail.01>failed</fail.01> <ARG2> to revive the residential construction industry </ARG2> .

<ARGM-ADV> By most measures </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG1> the nation 's industrial sector </ARG1> is <ARGM-TMP> now </ARGM-TMP> <grow.01>growing</grow.01> <ARG2-MNR> very slowly </ARG2-MNR> -- <ARGM-ADV> if at all </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG1> Factory payrolls </ARG1> <fall.01>fell</fall.01> <ARGM-TMP> in September </ARGM-TMP> .
Yet <ARG0> many economists </ARG0> are <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <predict.01>predicting</predict.01> <ARG1> that the economy is about to slip into recession </ARG1> .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <cite.01>cite</cite.01> <ARG1> a lack of `` imbalances '' that provide early warning signals of a downturn </ARG1> .
<ARG1> Inventories </ARG1> are <ARGM-MNR> closely </ARGM-MNR> <watch.01>watched</watch.01> <ARGM-PNC> for such clues </ARGM-PNC> , <ARGM-DIS> for instance </ARGM-DIS> .
<ARG0> Economists </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> yesterday 's factory orders report </ARG0> <have.03>had</have.03> <ARG1> good news on that front </ARG1> : it said factory inventories fell 0.1 % in September , the first decline since February 1987 .
`` <ARG1> This </ARG1> <conform.01>conforms</conform.01> <ARG2-to> to the ` soft landing ' scenario </ARG2-to> , '' said Elliott Platt , an economist at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp .
`` <ARG0> I </ARG0> do <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <see.01>see</see.01> <ARG1> any signs that inventories are excessive </ARG1> . ''
A soft landing is <ARG0> an economic slowdown that </ARG0> <ease.02>eases</ease.02> <ARG1> inflation </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> without leading to a recession </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> The department </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> orders for nondurable goods -- those intended to last fewer than three years -- fell 0.3 % in September to $ 109.73 billion after climbing 0.9 % the month before .
<ARG1> Orders for durable goods </ARG1> were up 0.2 % to $ 127.03 billion after <rise.01>rising</rise.01> <ARG2-EXT> 3.9 % </ARG2-EXT> <ARGM-TMP> the month before </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> The department </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> previously </ARGM-TMP> <estimate.01>estimated</estimate.01> <ARG1> that durable-goods orders fell 0.1 % in September </ARG1> .

<ARG1> Shipments have been relatively level since January </ARG1> , <ARG0> the Commerce Department </ARG0> <note.XX>noted</note.XX> .
<ARG1> Manufacturers ' backlogs of unfilled orders </ARG1> <rise.01>rose</rise.01> <ARG2-EXT> 0.5 % </ARG2-EXT> <ARGM-TMP> in September </ARGM-TMP> <ARG4-to> to $ 497.34 billion </ARG4-to> , <ARGM-ADV> helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector </ARGM-ADV> .
<exclude.01>Excluding</exclude.01> <ARG1> these orders </ARG1> , backlogs declined 0.3 % .
<ARGM-LOC> In its construction spending report </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> the Commerce Department </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> residential construction , which accounts for nearly half of all construction spending , was off 0.9 % in September to an annual rate of $ 191.9 billion .
<ARG0> David Berson , economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association , </ARG0> <predict.01>predicted</predict.01> the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single-family homes , but probably not until early next year .
Spending on private , nonresidential construction was off 2.6 % to an annual rate of $ 99.1 billion with <ARG0> no sector </ARG0> <show.01>showing</show.01> <ARG1> strength </ARG1> .
<ARG1> Government construction spending </ARG1> <rise.01>rose</rise.01> <ARG2-EXT> 4.3 % </ARG2-EXT> <ARG4-to> to $ 88 billion </ARG4-to> .
After <adjust.01>adjusting</adjust.01> <ARG4-for> for inflation </ARG4-for> , <ARG0> the Commerce Department </ARG0> said construction spending did n't change in September .
<ARGM-TMP> For the first nine months of the year </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> total construction spending </ARG1> <run.01>ran</run.01> <ARGM-MNR> about 2 % above last year 's level </ARGM-MNR> .

Although the purchasing managers ' index <continue.01>continues</continue.01> to indicate a slowing economy , it is n't signaling an imminent recession , said Robert Bretz , chairman of the association 's survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc. , Stamford , Conn .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the index would have to be in the low 40 % range for several months to be considered a forecast of recession .
<ARG0> The report </ARG0> <offer.01>offered</offer.01> <ARG1> new evidence that the nation 's export growth , though still continuing , may be slowing </ARG1> .
Only 19 % of the <purchase.01>purchasing</purchase.01> <ARG0> managers </ARG0> reported better export orders in October , down from 27 % in September .
<ARGM-DIS> And </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> 8 % </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> export orders were down last month , compared with 6 % the month before .
<ARG0> The purhasing managers ' report </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <add.02>added</add.02> <ARG1> evidence that inflation is under control </ARG1> .
For the fifth consecutive month , <purchase.01>purchasing</purchase.01> <ARG0> managers </ARG0> said prices for the goods they purchased fell .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in October than they had for each of the five previous months </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Economists </ARG0> <consider.01>consider</consider.01> <ARG1> that </ARG1> <ARG2> a sign that inflationary pressures are abating </ARG2> .
When demand is stronger than <ARG0> suppliers </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <handle.01>handle</handle.01> and delivery times lengthen , prices tend to rise .
<ARG1> The purchasing managers ' report </ARG1> is <base.02>based</base.02> <ARG2-on> on data provided by more than 250 purchasing executives </ARG2-on> .
<ARG0> Each of the survey 's indicators </ARG0> <gauge.01>gauges</gauge.01> <ARG1> the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> For the first time </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> the October survey </ARG0> <poll.01>polled</poll.01> <ARG1> members </ARG1> <ARG2-on> on imports </ARG2-on> .
<ARG0> It </ARG0> <find.01>found</find.01> that of the 73 % who import , 10 % said they imported more in October and 12 % said they imported less than the previous month .
While <acknowledge.01>acknowledging</acknowledge.01> one month 's figures do n't prove a trend , <ARG0> Mr. Bretz </ARG0> said , `` It does lead you to suspect imports are going down , or at least not increasing that much . ''
<ARG1> Items </ARG1> <list.01>listed</list.01> <ARG2-as> as being in short supply </ARG2-as> numbered only about a dozen , but they included one newcomer : milk and milk powder .
<ARG0> `` It 's an odd thing to <put.01>put</put.01> <ARG2-on> on the list </ARG2-on> , '' Mr. Bretz noted . </ARG0>
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that for the second month in a row , food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk </ARG1> .

Although <set.01>set</set.01> <ARGM-LOC> in Japan </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG1> the novel 's texture </ARG1> is almost entirely Western , especially American .
<ARG0> Characters </ARG0> <drink.01>drink</drink.01> <ARG1> Salty Dogs </ARG1> , whistle `` Johnny B. Goode '' and watch Bugs Bunny reruns .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <read.01>read</read.01> <ARG1> Mickey Spillane </ARG1> and talk about Groucho and Harpo .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <worry.02>worry</worry.02> <ARG1-about> about their careers </ARG1-about> , drink too much and suffer through broken marriages and desultory affairs .
<ARGM-ADV> For an American reader </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG1> part of the charm of this engaging novel </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> should </ARGM-MOD> <come.03>come</come.03> <ARG2-in> in recognizing that Japan is n't the buttoned-down society of contemporary American lore </ARG2-in> .
It 's <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <refresh.01>refreshing</refresh.01> <ARG0> to read a Japanese author who clearly does n't belong to the self-aggrandizing `` we-Japanese '' school of writers who perpetuate the notion of the unique Japanese , unfathomable by outsiders </ARG0> .
If `` <ARG0> A Wild Sheep Chase </ARG0> '' <carry.01>carries</carry.01> <ARG1> an implicit message </ARG1> <ARG4-for> for international relations </ARG4-for> , it 's that the Japanese are more like us than most of us think .
<ARG0> That 's not to <say.01>say</say.01> <ARG1> that the nutty plot of `` A Wild Sheep Chase '' is rooted in reality </ARG1> . </ARG0>
<ARG0> A disaffected , hard-drinking , nearly-30 hero </ARG0> <set.04>sets</set.04> off <ARG1-for> for snow country </ARG1-for> <ARGM-PNC> in search of an elusive sheep with a star on its back </ARGM-PNC> <ARGM-ADV> at the behest of a sinister , erudite mobster with a Stanford degree </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <have.03>has</have.03> <ARGM-MNR> in tow </ARGM-MNR> <ARG1> his prescient girlfriend , whose sassy retorts mark her as anything but a docile butterfly </ARG1> .
<ARGM-ADV> Along the way </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> he </ARG0> <meet.02>meets</meet.02> <ARG1> a solicitous Christian chauffeur who offers the hero God 's phone number ; and the Sheep Man , a sweet , roughhewn figure who wears -- what else -- a sheepskin </ARG1> .
A more recent novel , `` Norwegian Wood '' -LRB- every Japanese under 40 <seem.01>seems</seem.01> to be fluent in Beatles lyrics -RRB- , has sold more than four million copies since Kodansha published it in 1987 .
But he is just one of <ARG0> several youthful writers -- Tokyo 's brat pack -- who </ARG0> are <dominate.01>dominating</dominate.01> <ARG1> the best-seller charts </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> in Japan </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG1> Their books </ARG1> are <write.01>written</write.01> <ARGM-MNR> in idiomatic , contemporary language </ARGM-MNR> and usually carry hefty dashes of Americana .
<ARGM-LOC> In Robert Whiting 's `` You Gotta Have Wa '' -LRB- Macmillan , 339 pages , $ 17.95 -RRB- </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> the Beatles </ARG0> <give.01>give</give.01> <ARG1> way </ARG1> to baseball , in the Nipponese version we would be hard put to call a `` game . ''
As <ARG0> Mr. Whiting </ARG0> <describe.01>describes</describe.01> <ARG1> it </ARG1> , Nipponese baseball is a `` mirror of Japan 's fabled virtues of hard work and harmony . ''
`` Wa '' is Japanese for `` team spirit '' and <ARG0> Japanese ballplayers </ARG0> <have.03>have</have.03> <ARG1> miles and miles of it </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Polls </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> once </ARGM-TMP> <name.01>named</name.01> <ARG1> Tokyo Giants star Tatsunori Hara , a `` humble , uncomplaining , obedient soul , '' </ARG1> <ARG2-as> as the male symbol of Japan </ARG2-as> .
But other than the fact that <ARG1> besuboru </ARG1> is <play.01>played</play.01> <ARGM-MNR> with a ball and a bat </ARGM-MNR> , it 's unrecognizable : Fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers ; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter ; ties are permitted -- even welcomed -- since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat ; players must abide by strict rules of conduct even in their personal lives -- players for the Tokyo Giants , for example , must always wear ties when on the road .
`` You Gotta Have Wa '' is the often amusing chronicle of how <ARG1> American ballplayers </ARG1> , <ration.01>rationed</ration.01> <ARG2-to> to two per team </ARG2-to> , fare in Japan .
Despite the enormous sums of money <ARG0> they </ARG0> 're <pay.01>paid</pay.01> <ARG3> to stand up at a Japanese plate </ARG3> , a good number decide it 's not worth it and run for home .
It 's the petulant complaint of <ARG1> an impudent American whom </ARG1> <ARG0> Sony </ARG0> <host.01>hosted</host.01> <ARGM-TMP> for a year </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-TMP> while he was on a Luce Fellowship in Tokyo </ARGM-TMP> -- <ARGM-ADV> to the regret of both parties </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARGM-LOC> In sometimes amusing , more often supercilious , even vicious passages </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> Mr. Katzenstein </ARG0> <describe.01>describes</describe.01> <ARG1> how Sony invades even the most mundane aspects of its workers ' lives -- at the regimented office , where employees are assigned lunch partners -- and at `` home '' in the austere company dormitory run by a prying caretaker </ARG1> .
It 's probably true that <ARG0> many salarymen </ARG0> <put.05>put</put.05> in <ARG1> unproductive overtime </ARG1> <ARGM-PNC> just for the sake of solidarity </ARGM-PNC> , that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager , and that Sony was chary of letting a young , short-term American employee take on any responsibility .
<ARG0> All of this </ARG0> must have been <ARGM-MNR> enormously </ARGM-MNR> <frustrate.01>frustrating</frustrate.01> <ARG1-to> to Mr. Katzenstein , who went to Sony with degrees in business and computer science and was raring to invent another Walkman </ARG1-to> .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> Sony </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> ultimately </ARGM-TMP> <take.01>took</take.01> <ARG1> a lesson </ARG1> <ARG2-from> from the American management books </ARG2-from> and fired Mr. Katzenstein , <ARGM-TMP> after he committed the social crime of making an appointment to see the venerable Akio Morita , founder of Sony </ARGM-TMP> .
It 's a shame <ARG1> their meeting </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> never </ARGM-TMP> <take.14>took</take.14> <ARG2> place </ARG2> .
<ARG0> Mr. Katzenstein </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> certainly </ARGM-ADV> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> have <learn.01>learned</learn.01> <ARG1> something </ARG1> , and it 's even possible Mr. Morita would have too .

But it is <ARG0> Mr. Lane , as movie director , producer and writer , who </ARG0> has been <obsess.01>obsessed</obsess.01> <ARG1-with> with refitting Chaplin 's Little Tramp in a contemporary way </ARG1-with> .
<ARGM-TMP> In 1976 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-PRD> as a film student at the Purchase campus of the State University of New York </ARGM-PRD> , <ARG0> Mr. Lane </ARG0> <shoot.03>shot</shoot.03> <ARG1> `` A Place in Time , '' a 36-minute black-and-white film about a sketch artist , a man of the streets </ARG1> .

Of course , if <ARG0> the film </ARG0> <contain.01>contained</contain.01> <ARG1> dialogue </ARG1> , Mr. Lane 's Artist would be called a homeless person .
<ARG0> I </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> `` <ARG1> contained dialogue </ARG1> '' <ARGM-CAU> because `` Sidewalk Stories '' is n't really silent at all </ARGM-CAU> .
Composer Marc Marder , a college friend of Mr. Lane 's who <earn.01>earns</earn.01> <ARG1> his living </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> playing the double bass in classical music ensembles </ARGM-MNR> , has prepared an exciting , eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles , or even words , would .
<ARG0> Much of Mr. Lane 's film </ARG0> <take.01>takes</take.01> <ARG1> a highly romanticized view of life on the streets -LRB- though probably no more romanticized than Mr. Chaplin 's notion of the Tramp as the good-hearted free spirit -RRB- </ARG1> .
<film.01>Filmed</film.01> <ARGM-MNR> in lovely black and white </ARGM-MNR> <ARG0-by> by Bill Dill </ARG0-by> , <ARG1> the New York streets of `` Sidewalk Stories '' </ARG1> seem benign .
<ARGM-LOC> On Wall Street </ARGM-LOC> <ARG0> men and women </ARG0> <walk.01>walk</walk.01> <ARGM-MNR> with great purpose </ARGM-MNR> , <ARGM-ADV> noticing one another only when they jostle for cabs </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG1> The Artist </ARG1> <hang.02>hangs</hang.02> <ARG2-MNR> out </ARG2-MNR> <ARGM-LOC> in Greenwich Village </ARGM-LOC> , <ARGM-LOC> on a strip of Sixth Avenue populated by jugglers , magicians and other good-natured hustlers </ARGM-LOC> .
-LRB- This clearly is not real life : no crack dealers , <ARG0> no dead-eyed men </ARG0> <sell.01>selling</sell.01> <ARG1> four-year-old copies of Cosmopolitan </ARG1> , no one curled up in a cardboard box . -RRB-
<ARG0> The Artist </ARG0> <have.03>has</have.03> <ARG1> his routine </ARG1> .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <spend.02>spends</spend.02> <ARG1> his days </ARG1> <ARG2> sketching passers-by , or trying to </ARG2> .
<ARGM-TMP> At night </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> he </ARG1> <return.01>returns</return.01> to the condemned building he calls home .
<ARG2> His life </ARG2> , <include.01>including</include.01> <ARG1> his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist </ARG1> , seems carefree .
Then , just as <ARG2> the Tramp </ARG2> is <give.01>given</give.01> a blind girl to cure <ARGM-LOC> in `` City Lights </ARGM-LOC> , '' the Artist is put in charge of returning a two-year-old waif -LRB- Nicole Alysia -RRB- , whose father has been murdered by thugs , to her mother .
This cute child <turn.11>turns</turn.11> out to be a blessing and a curse .
<ARG0> She </ARG0> <give.01>gives</give.01> <ARG2> the Artist </ARG2> <ARG1> a sense of purpose </ARG1> , but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life .
The beds at the Bowery Mission <seem.01>seem</seem.01> far drearier <ARGM-TMP> when he has to tuck a little girl into one of them at night </ARGM-TMP> .
To <ARGM-MNR> further </ARGM-MNR> <load.01>load</load.01> <ARG1> the stakes </ARG1> , <ARG0> Mr. Lane </ARG0> dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the Artist , with a young woman who owns her own children 's shop and who lives in an expensive high-rise apartment building .
<ARG1> This story line </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> might </ARGM-MOD> <resonate.01>resonate</resonate.01> <ARGM-MNR> more strongly </ARGM-MNR> <ARGM-ADV> if Mr. Lane had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> Mr. Lane 's </ARG0> final purpose is n't to <glamorize.01>glamorize</glamorize.01> <ARG1> the Artist 's vagabond existence </ARG1> .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <have.03>has</have.03> a point he wants to make , and he makes it , with a great deal of force .
<ARG1> The movie </ARG1> <end.01>ends</end.01> <ARGM-MNR> with sound , the sound of street people talking , </ARGM-MNR> and there is n't anything whimsical or enviable in those rough , beaten voices .
<ARG0> The French film maker Claude Chabrol </ARG0> has <manage.02>managed</manage.02> <ARG1> another kind of weird achievement </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> with his `` Story of Women </ARGM-MNR> . ''
<ARG0> He </ARG0> has <make.01>made</make.01> <ARG1> a harsh , brilliant picture -- one that 's captivating -- about a character who , viewed from the most sympathetic angle , would seem disagreeable </ARG1> .
<ARGM-DIS> Yet </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> this woman , Marie-Louise Giraud , </ARG0> <carry.01>carries</carry.01> <ARG1> historical significance </ARG1> , both as one of the last women to be executed in France and as a symbol of the Vichy government 's hypocrisy .
While <ARG0> Vichy </ARG0> <collaborate.01>collaborated</collaborate.01> <ARG1-with> with the Germans </ARG1-with> <ARGM-TMP> during World War II </ARGM-TMP> <ARG2-in> in the deaths of thousands of Resistance fighters and Jews </ARG2-in> , its officials needed a diversionary symbolic traitor .
<ARG1> She </ARG1> <become.01>became</become.01> <ARG2> an abortionist </ARG2> <ARGM-MNR> accidentally </ARGM-MNR> , and continued because it enabled her to buy jam , cocoa and other war-rationed goodies .
<ARG0> She </ARG0> was untrained and , <ARGM-LOC> in one botched job </ARGM-LOC> <kill.01>killed</kill.01> <ARG1> a client </ARG1> .
<ARGM-ADV> Although <ARG0> she </ARG0> was kind and playful to her children </ARGM-ADV> , she was dreadful to her war-damaged husband ; she <ARGM-MNR> openly </ARGM-MNR> <bring.01>brought</bring.01> <ARG1> her lover </ARG1> <ARG3-into> into their home </ARG3-into> .
As <present.01>presented</present.01> <ARG0-by> by Mr. Chabrol </ARG0-by> , and played with thin-lipped intensity by Isabelle Huppert , <ARG1> Marie-Louise -LRB- called Marie Latour in the film -RRB- </ARG1> was not a nice person .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> she </ARG0> did <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <deserve.01>deserve</deserve.01> <ARG1> to have her head chopped off </ARG1> .
There is very little to <recommend.01>recommend</recommend.01> <ARG1> `` Old Gringo , '' a confused rendering of the Carlos Fuentes novel of the Mexican Revolution </ARG1> .
<ARG1> Most of the picture </ARG1> is <take.13>taken</take.13> up <ARG0-with> with endless scenes of many people either fighting or eating and drinking to celebrate victory </ARG0-with> .
<ARG0> I </ARG0> <mention.01>mention</mention.01> <ARG1> the picture </ARG1> only because many bad movies have a bright spot , and this one has Gregory Peck , in a marvelously loose and energetic portrayal of an old man who wants to die the way he wants to die .
<ARG0> Video Tip : Before <see.01>seeing</see.01> `` <ARG1> Sidewalk Stories </ARG1> , '' take a look at `` City Lights , '' Chaplin 's Tramp at his finest . </ARG0>
<ARG0> Boeing Co. </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it is discussing plans with three of its regular Japanese suppliers to possibly help build a larger version of its popular 767 twin-jet .
The discussions are still in preliminary stages , and <ARG1> the specific details </ARG1> have <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> been <work.02>worked</work.02> out <ARG0-between> between the Seattle aerospace company and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. , Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd </ARG0-between> .
<ARG0> The three Japanese companies </ARG0> <build.01>build</build.01> <ARG1> the body sections of the 767 </ARG1> , <ARGM-ADV> accounting for a combined 15 % of the aircraft </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> Japanese press reports </ARG0> have <speculate.01>speculated</speculate.01> <ARG1> that the Japanese contribution could rise to between 20 % and 25 % under the new program </ARG1> .
If <ARG0> Boeing </ARG0> <go.06>goes</go.06> <ARG2-DIR> ahead </ARG2-DIR> <ARG1-with> with the larger 767 </ARG1-with> , the plane could hit the market in the mid-1990s .
This is the year <ARG1> the negative ad , for years a secondary presence in most political campaigns , </ARG1> <become.01>became</become.01> <ARG2> the main event </ARG2> .
The irony is that <ARG0> the attack commercial </ARG0> , after <get.01>getting</get.01> <ARG1> a boost </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> in last year 's presidential campaign </ARGM-LOC> , has come of age in an off-off election year with only a few contests scattered across the country .
But in the three <lead.01>leading</lead.01> <ARG0> political contests </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> of 1989 </ARGM-TMP> , the negative ads have reached new levels of hostility , raising fears that this kind of mudslinging , empty of significant issues , is ushering in a new era of campaigns without content .
`` Now , '' <say.01>says</say.01> <ARG0> Joseph Napolitan , a pioneer in political television </ARG0> , `` the idea is to attack first , last and always . ''
<ARG1> A trend that </ARG1> <start.01>started</start.01> <ARG2-with> with the first stirrings of politics </ARG2-with> , accelerated with the dawn of the television age and became a sometimes-tawdry art form in 1988 , has reached an entirely new stage .
`` To <get.01>get</get.01> <ARG1> people 's attention </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> these days </ARGM-TMP> , '' says Douglas Bailey , a political consultant , `` <ARG0> your TV ad </ARG0> needs to be bold and entertaining , and , more often than not , that means confrontational .
<ARGM-DIS> And </ARGM-DIS> , <ARGM-MNR> unlike a few years ago </ARGM-MNR> , you do <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <ARGM-ADV> even </ARGM-ADV> <have.02>have</have.02> to worry whether the ad is truthful . ''
<ARGM-TMP> In 1989 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-TMP> as often as not </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> the principal fights in the major campaigns </ARG1> are <prompt.01>prompted</prompt.01> <ARG0-by> by the ads themselves </ARG0-by> .
<take.01><ARG0></take.01> a look , <ARGM-DIS> then </ARGM-DIS> , at the main attack commercials that set the tone for Tuesday 's elections in New York City , New Jersey and Virginia : </ARG0>
<ARG1> The screen </ARG1> <fill.01>fills</fill.01> <ARG2-with> with a small , tight facial shot of David Dinkins , Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City </ARG2-with> .
`` <ARG1> David Dinkins </ARG1> <fail.01>failed</fail.01> <ARG2> to file his income taxes </ARG2> <ARGM-TMP> for four straight years </ARGM-TMP> , '' says a disembodied male voice .
And then <ARG3-for> this television commercial </ARG3-for> , <pay.01>paid</pay.01> for <ARG0-by> by Republican Rudolph Giuliani 's campaign </ARG0-by> and produced by Roger Ailes , the master of negative TV ads , really gets down to business .
Mr. Dinkins , <ARG0> the ad </ARG0> <charge.06>charges</charge.06> , also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately , hid his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted kidnapper `` through a phony organization with no members , no receipts and no office . ''
`` David Dinkins , '' <say.01>says</say.01> <ARG0> the kicker </ARG0> , `` Why does he always wait until he 's caught ? ''
`` Nasty innuendoes , '' <say.01>says</say.01> <ARG0> John Siegal , Mr. Dinkins 's issues director , </ARG0> `` designed to prosecute a case of political corruption that simply does n't exist . ''
<sting.01>Stung</sting.01> <ARG0-by> by the Giuliani ads </ARG0-by> , <ARG1> Mr. Dinkins 's TV consultants , Robert Shrum and David Doak , </ARG1> finally unleashed a negative ad of their own .
<ARG0> The screen </ARG0> <show.01>shows</show.01> <ARG1> two distorted , unrecognizable photos , presumably of two politicians </ARG1> .
<ARG0> `` <compare.01>Compare</compare.01> <ARG1> two candidates for mayor </ARG1> , '' says the announcer . </ARG0>
`` <ARG0> One </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> he 's for banning cop-killer bullets .
<ARG0> The other </ARG0> has <oppose.01>opposed</oppose.01> <ARG1> a ban on cop-killer bullets </ARG1> .
<ARG0> One </ARG0> <claim.01>claims</claim.01> he 's pro-choice .
<ARG0> The other </ARG0> has <oppose.01>opposed</oppose.01> <ARG1> a woman 's right to choose </ARG1> . ''
`` Funny thing , '' <say.01>says</say.01> <ARG0> the kicker </ARG0> , `` both these candidates are named Rudolph Giuliani . ''
<ARG0> Who </ARG0> 's <tell.01>telling</tell.01> <ARG1> the truth </ARG1> ?
<ARG1> Mr. Dinkins </ARG1> did <fail.01>fail</fail.01> <ARG2> to file his income taxes </ARG2> <ARGM-TMP> for four years </ARGM-TMP> , but he insists he voluntarily admitted the `` oversight '' when he was being considered for a city job .
He was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems , but <ARG0> he </ARG0> <insist.01>insists</insist.01> he made no secret of it .
<ARG0> The city 's Campaign Finance Board </ARG0> has <refuse.01>refused</refuse.01> <ARG1> to pay Mr. Dinkins $ 95,142 in matching funds </ARG1> <ARGM-CAU> because his campaign records are incomplete </ARGM-CAU> .
<ARG0> The campaign </ARG0> has <blame.01>blamed</blame.01> <ARG2> these reporting problems </ARG2> <ARG1-on> on computer errors </ARG1-on> .
And , <say.01>says</say.01> <ARG0> Mr. Dinkins </ARG0> , he did n't know the man his campaign paid for a get-out-the-vote effort had been convicted of kidnapping .
But , <say.01>say</say.01> <ARG0> Mr. Dinkins 's managers </ARG0> , he did have an office and his organization did have members .
<ARG0> Mr. Giuliani 's campaign chairman , Peter Powers , </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> the Dinkins ad is `` deceptive . ''
The other side , <ARG0> he </ARG0> <argue.01>argues</argue.01> , `` knows Giuliani has always been pro-choice , even though he has personal reservations .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <know.01>know</know.01> he is generally opposed to cop-killer bullets , but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation . ''
<ARG0> Democratic Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder </ARG0> <open.01>opened</open.01> <ARG1> his gubernatorial battle with Republican Marshall Coleman </ARG1> with an abortion commercial produced by Frank Greer that analysts of every political persuasion agree was a tour de force .
Against <ARG1> a shot </ARG1> of Monticello <superimpose.01>superimposed</superimpose.01> <ARG2-on> on an American flag </ARG2-on> , an announcer talks about the `` strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty '' that Virginians have nurtured for generations .
Then , just as <ARG1> an image of the statue of Thomas Jefferson </ARG1> <dissolve.01>dissolves</dissolve.01> <ARGM-DIR> from the screen </ARGM-DIR> , the announcer continues : `` On the issue of abortion , Marshall Coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians . ''
That commercial -- which <say.01>said</say.01> Mr. Coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion `` even in cases of rape and incest , '' a charge Mr. Coleman denies -- changed the dynamics of the campaign , transforming it , at least in part , into a referendum on abortion .
<ARG0> The ad </ARG0> <prompt.02>prompted</prompt.02> <ARG1> Mr. Coleman , the former Virginia attorney general , </ARG1> <ARG2> to launch a series of advertisements created by Bob Goodman and designed to shake Mr. Wilder 's support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad </ARG2> .
<ARG0> The Coleman counterattack </ARG0> <feature.01>featured</feature.01> <ARG1> a close-up of a young woman in shadows </ARG1> and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal .
<ARG0> A voice </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> , `` <ARG1> C'mon , now , do n't you have boyfriends ? </ARG1> ''
<ARGM-TMP> Then </ARGM-TMP> <ARG0> an announcer </ARG0> <interject.01>interjects</interject.01> : `` It was Douglas Wilder who introduced a bill to force rape victims age 13 and younger to be interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists .
So the next time <ARG0> Mr. Wilder </ARG0> <talk.01>talks</talk.01> <ARG1-about> about the rights of women </ARG1-about> , ask him about this law he tried to pass . ''
<ARG0> Mr. Wilder </ARG0> did <introduce.02>introduce</introduce.02> <ARG1> such legislation </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> 17 years ago </ARGM-TMP> , but he did so at the request of a constituent , a common legislative technique used by lawmakers .
<ARG0> The legislation itself </ARG0> <note.XX>noted</note.XX> <ARG1> that it was introduced `` by request </ARG1> , '' and in 1983 Mr. Wilder introduced a bill to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation .
`` <ARG1> People </ARG1> have <grow.02>grown</grow.02> <ARG2> tired of these ads </ARG2> and Coleman has gotten the stigma of being a negative campaigner , '' says Mark Rozell , a political scientist at Mary Washington College .
`` <ARG0> Wilder </ARG0> has <manage.02>managed</manage.02> <ARG1> to get across the idea that Coleman will say anything to get elected governor </ARG1> and -- more important -- has been able to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on Coleman . ''
<ARG0> Mr. Coleman </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARGM-TMP> this week </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning </ARG1> , but the truce lasted only hours .
<ARGM-TMP> By Tuesday night </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> television stations </ARG0> were <carry.01>carrying</carry.01> <ARG1> new ads featuring Mr. Coleman himself raising questions about Mr. Wilder 's sensitivity to rape victims </ARG1> .
<ARG1> The attacks </ARG1> <begin.01>began</begin.01> <ARGM-TMP> when Democratic Rep. James Florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of Pinocchio and a photograph of Mr. Florio 's rival , Republican Rep. Jim Courter </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> `` <remember.01>Remember</remember.01> <ARG1> Pinocchio </ARG1> ? '' says a female voice . </ARG0>
<ARG0> `` <consider.01>Consider</consider.01> <ARG1> Jim Courter </ARG1> . '' </ARG0>
And then <ARG1> this commercial </ARG1> , <produce.01>produced</produce.01> <ARG0-by> by Bob Squier </ARG0-by> , gets down to its own mean and dirty business .
Pictures of <rust.01>rusted</rust.01> <ARG1> oil drums </ARG1> swim into focus , and the female voice purrs , `` That hazardous waste on his -LCB- Mr. Courter 's -RCB- property -- the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud . ''
<ARGM-DIS> And </ARGM-DIS> <ARG1> the nose on Mr. Courter 's face </ARG1> <grow.01>grows</grow.01> .
<ARG1> The only fraud </ARG1> <involve.01>involved</involve.01> , cry Mr. Courter 's partisans , is the Florio commercial itself , and so the Courter campaign has responded with its own Pinocchio commercial , produced by Mr. Ailes .
<ARGM-LOC> In this one </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG1> the screen </ARG1> <fill.01>fills</fill.01> <ARG2-with> with photographs of both candidates </ARG2-with> .
`` <ARG0> Who </ARG0> 's <ARGM-MNR> really </ARGM-MNR> <lie.02>lying</lie.02> ? '' asks a female voice .
`` <ARG0> Florio </ARG0> 's <lie.02>lying</lie.02> , '' the voice goes on , <ARGM-CAU> because `` the barrel on Courter 's land ... contained heating oil , was cleaned up and caused no pollution </ARGM-CAU> . ''
<ARG1> Mr. Courter 's long nose </ARG1> <shrink.01>shrinks</shrink.01> <ARGM-TMP> while Mr. Florio 's grows </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> Who </ARG0> 's <tell.01>telling</tell.01> <ARG1> the truth </ARG1> ?
<ARG0> Stephen Salmore , a political scientist at New Jersey 's Eagleton Institute , </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> it 's another example of an ad that 's true but not fully accurate .
<ARG1> Barrels </ARG1> were <dump.01>dumped</dump.01> <ARGM-LOC> on the Courter property </ARGM-LOC> , a complaint was made , but there is no evidence the barrels were a serious threat to the environment .
<ARGM-DIS> Even so </ARGM-DIS> , <ARGM-ADV> according to Mr. Salmore </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> the ad </ARG0> was `` <devastate.01>devastating</devastate.01> '' <ARGM-CAU> because it raised questions about Mr. Courter 's credibility </ARGM-CAU> .
But <ARG0> it </ARG0> 's <build.01>building</build.01> <ARG2-on> on a long tradition </ARG2-on> .
<ARGM-TMP> In 1966 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-LOC> on route to a re-election rout of Democrat Frank O'Connor </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG1> GOP Gov.

<ARGM-DIS> Rather </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG2> Japanese investment </ARG2> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <spur.01>spur</spur.01> <ARG1> integration of certain sectors </ARG1> , says Kent Calder , a specialist in East Asian economies at the Woodrow Wilson School for Public and Internatonal Affairs at Princeton University .
<ARGM-LOC> In electronics </ARGM-LOC> , <ARGM-DIS> for example </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> a Japanese company </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> might </ARGM-MOD> <make.01>make</make.01> <ARG1> television picture tubes </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> in Japan </ARGM-LOC> , assemble the sets in Malaysia and export them to Indonesia .
<ARG0> `` The effect will be to <pull.01>pull</pull.01> <ARG1> Asia </ARG1> <ARG2> together </ARG2> <ARGM-MNR> not as a common market but as an integrated production zone </ARGM-MNR> , '' says Goldman Sachs 's Mr. Hormats . </ARG0>
<ARG0> Countries in the region </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> are <begin.01>beginning</begin.01> <ARG1> to consider a framework for closer economic and political ties </ARG1> .

<ARGM-DIS> In addition </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> the U.S. </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> this year </ARGM-TMP> <offer.01>offered</offer.01> <ARG1> its own plan for cooperation around the Pacific rim </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> in a major speech by Secretary of State James Baker , following up a proposal made in January by Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG0> The Baker proposal </ARG0> <reassert.03>reasserts</reassert.03> <ARG1> Washington 's intention to continue playing a leading political role in the region </ARG1> .
`` <ARGM-LOC> In Asia </ARGM-LOC> , <ARGM-ADV> as in Europe </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> a new order </ARG0> is <take.01>taking</take.01> <ARG1> shape </ARG1> , '' Mr. Baker said .
`` <ARG0> The U.S. </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> , with its regional friends , </ARGM-ADV> <ARGM-MOD> must </ARGM-MOD> <play.02>play</play.02> <ARG1> a crucial role </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> in designing its architecture </ARGM-LOC> . ''
<ARG0> But <maintain.01>maintaining</maintain.01> <ARG1> U.S. influence </ARG1> will be difficult in the face of Japanese dominance in the region . </ARG0>
<ARG0> Japan </ARG0> not only <outstrip.01>outstrips</outstrip.01> <ARG1> the U.S. </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> in investment flows </ARGM-LOC> but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries -LRB- although the U.S. remains the leading trade partner for all of Asia -RRB- .
<ARGM-DIS> Moreover </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> the Japanese government , now the world 's largest aid donor , </ARG0> is <pump.01>pumping</pump.01> far more assistance <ARG1-into> into the region </ARG1-into> than the U.S. is .
While <ARG0> U.S. officials </ARG0> <voice.01>voice</voice.01> <ARG1> optimism about Japan 's enlarged role in Asia </ARG1> , they also convey an undertone of caution .
`` There 's an understanding on the part of the U.S. that Japan <have.02>has</have.02> to expand its functions '' in Asia , says J. Michael Farren , undersecretary of commerce for trade .
`` If <ARG1> they </ARG1> <approach.02>approach</approach.02> <ARG2> it </ARG2> <ARGM-MNR> with a benevolent , altruistic attitude </ARGM-MNR> , there will be a net gain for everyone . ''
Some Asian nations are apprehensive about Washington 's demand that <ARG0> Tokyo </ARG0> <step.03>step</step.03> up <ARG1> its military spending </ARG1> <ARGM-PNC> to ease the U.S. security burden in the region </ARGM-PNC> .
<ARG0> Many Asians </ARG0> <regard.01>regard</regard.01> <ARG1> a U.S. presence </ARG1> <ARG2-as> as a desirable counterweight to Japanese influence </ARG2-as> .
`` <ARG0> No one </ARG0> <want.01>wants</want.01> <ARG1> the U.S. to pick up its marbles and go home </ARG1> , '' Mr. Hormats says .
<ARGM-DIS> For their part </ARGM-DIS> , Taiwan and South Korea are <expect.01>expected</expect.01> to step up their own investments in the next decade to try to slow the Japanese juggernaut .
`` <ARG0> They </ARG0> do <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <want.01>want</want.01> <ARG1> Japan to monopolize the region and sew it up </ARG1> , '' says Chong-sik Lee , professor of East Asian politics at the University of Pennsylvania .

<ARG0> She </ARG0> had <see.01>seen</see.01> <ARG1> cheating </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> before </ARGM-TMP> , but these notes were uncanny .
<ARGM-TMP> At the end of World War II </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Germany </ARG0> <surrender.01>surrendered</surrender.01> <ARGM-TMP> before Japan </ARGM-TMP> ... .
<ARG1> The Senate-House conference committee </ARG1> is <use.01>used</use.01> <ARGM-TMP> when a bill is passed by the House and Senate in different forms </ARGM-TMP> . ''
<ARGM-MNR> Virtually word for word </ARGM-MNR> , <ARG1> the notes </ARG1> <match.01>matched</match.01> questions and answers on the social-studies section of the test the student was taking .
<ARGM-DIS> In fact </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> the student </ARG0> <have.03>had</have.03> <ARG1> the answers to almost all of the 40 questions in that section </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The student </ARG0> <surrender.01>surrendered</surrender.01> <ARG1> the notes </ARG1> , but not without a protest .
`` <ARG0> My teacher </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it was OK for me to use the notes on the test , '' he said .
The teacher in question was <ARG1> Nancy Yeargin </ARG1> -- <consider.01>considered</consider.01> <ARG0-by> by many students and parents </ARG0-by> <ARG2> to be one of the best at the school </ARG2> .
<confront.01>Confronted</confront.01> , <ARG1> Mrs. Yeargin </ARG1> admitted she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two low-ability geography classes .
<ARG1> She </ARG1> had <go.01>gone</go.01> <ARG2> so far as to display the questions on an overhead projector and underline the answers </ARG2> .
<ARG1> Mrs. Yeargin </ARG1> was <fire.02>fired</fire.02> and prosecuted <ARGM-ADV> under an unusual South Carolina law that makes it a crime to breach test security </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARGM-TMP> In September </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> she </ARG0> <plead.02>pleaded</plead.02> <ARG1> guilty </ARG1> and paid a $ 500 fine .
She was <ARG0> an unstinting teacher who </ARG0> <win.01>won</win.01> <ARG1> laurels </ARG1> and inspired students , but she will probably never teach again .
<ARGM-LOC> In her wake </ARGM-LOC> <ARG0> she </ARG0> <leave.02>left</leave.02> the bitterness and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a betrayer ; of colleagues who say she brought them shame ; of students and parents who defended her and insist she was treated harshly ; and of school-district officials stunned that despite the bald-faced nature of her actions , she became something of a local martyr .
<ARG0> Mrs. Yeargin 's case </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <cast.01>casts</cast.01> <ARG1> some light </ARG1> <ARG2-on> on the dark side of school reform , where pressures on teachers are growing and where high-stakes testing has enhanced the temptation to cheat </ARG2-on> .
The 1987 statute <ARG0> Mrs. Yeargin </ARG0> <violate.01>violated</violate.01> was designed to enforce provisions of South Carolina 's school-improvement laws .
<ARG0> Prosecutors </ARG0> <allege.01>alleged</allege.01> <ARG1> that she was trying to bolster students ' scores to win a bonus under the state 's 1984 Education Improvement Act </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The bonus </ARG0> <depend.01>depended</depend.01> <ARG1-on> on her ability to produce higher student-test scores </ARG1-on> .
`` There is incredible pressure on <ARG0> school systems and teachers </ARG0> to <raise.01>raise</raise.01> <ARG1> test scores </ARG1> , '' says Walt Haney , an education professor and testing specialist at Boston College .
<ARG0> `` So efforts to <beat.03>beat</beat.03> <ARG1> the tests </ARG1> are also on the rise . '' </ARG0>
And most disturbing , it is educators , not students , who are <blame.01>blamed</blame.01> <ARG2-for> for much of the wrongdoing </ARG2-for> .
<ARG1> A 50-state study </ARG1> <release.01>released</release.01> <ARGM-TMP> in September </ARGM-TMP> <ARG0-by> by Friends for Education , an Albuquerque , N.M. , school-research group , </ARG0-by> concluded that `` outright cheating by American educators '' is `` common . ''
<ARG0> The group </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often `` teach the test '' as Mrs. Yeargin did , although most are never caught .
<ARG1> Evidence of widespread cheating </ARG1> has <surface.01>surfaced</surface.01> <ARGM-LOC> in several states </ARGM-LOC> <ARGM-TMP> in the last year or so </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> California 's education department </ARG0> <suspect.01>suspects</suspect.01> <ARG1> adult responsibility for erasures at 40 schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> After numerous occurrences of questionable teacher help to students </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Texas </ARG0> is <revise.01>revising</revise.01> <ARG1> its security practices </ARG1> .
<ARGM-DIS> And </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> sales of test-coaching booklets for classroom instruction </ARG0> are <boom.02>booming</boom.02> .
<ARG2> These materials </ARG2> , <include.01>including</include.01> <ARG1> Macmillan\/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. 's Scoring High and Learning Materials </ARG1> -- are nothing short of sophisticated crib sheets , according to some recent academic research .
By <use.01>using</use.01> <ARG1> them </ARG1> , <ARG0> teachers </ARG0> -- with administrative blessing -- telegraph to students beforehand the precise areas on which a test will concentrate , and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers .
<ARG0> Experts </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> there is n't another state in the country where tests mean as much as they do in South Carolina .
<ARGM-ADV> Under the state 's Education Improvement Act </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG3> low test scores </ARG3> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <block.01>block</block.01> <ARG1> students ' promotions </ARG1> or force entire districts into wrenching , state-supervised `` interventions '' that can mean firings .
<ARG0> High test scores </ARG0> , <ARGM-DIS> on the other hand </ARGM-DIS> , <bring.01>bring</bring.01> <ARG1> recognition and extra money -- a new computer lab for a school , grants for special projects , a bonus for the superintendent </ARG1> .
And <ARG0> South Carolina </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> it is getting results .
Since <ARG1> the reforms </ARG1> <go.06>went</go.06> <ARG2-in> in place </ARG2-in> , for example , no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the Scholastic Aptitude Test than South Carolina , although the state still posts the lowest average score of the about 21 states who use the SAT as the primary college entrance examination .
<ARG0> Critics </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> South Carolina is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much .
<ARG0> Friends of Education </ARG0> <rate.01>rates</rate.01> <ARG1> South Carolina </ARG1> <ARG2> one of the worst seven states </ARG2> <ARGM-LOC> in its study on academic cheating </ARGM-LOC> .
<say.01>Says</say.01> <ARG0> the organization 's founder , John Cannell , </ARG0> prosecuting Mrs. Yeargin is `` a way for administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously , when in fact they do n't take it seriously at all . ''
<ARG0> Paul Sandifer , director of testing for the South Carolina department of education , </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> Mr. Cannell 's allegations of cheating `` are purely without foundation , '' and based on unfair inferences .
<ARGM-CAU> Partly because of worries about potential abuse </ARGM-CAU> , <ARGM-DIS> however </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> he </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> the state will begin keeping closer track of achievement-test preparation booklets next spring .
<ARG1> South Carolina 's reforms </ARG1> were <design.01>designed</design.01> <ARG2-for> for schools like Greenville High School </ARG2-for> .
<stand.01>Standing</stand.01> <ARG2-on> on a shaded hill </ARG2-on> <ARGM-LOC> in a run-down area of this old textile city </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG1> the school </ARG1> has educated many of South Carolina 's best and brightest , including the state 's last two governors , Nobel Prize winning physicist Charles Townes and actress Joanne Woodward .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARGM-TMP> by the early 1980s </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> its glory </ARG1> had <fade.01>faded</fade.01> <ARGM-MNR> like the yellow bricks of its broad facade </ARGM-MNR> .
`` It was full of violence and gangs and <ARG0> kids </ARG0> <cut.03>cutting</cut.03> <ARG1> class </ARG1> , '' says Linda Ward , the school 's principal .
<ARG0> Mrs. Ward </ARG0> <take.12>took</take.12> over <ARGM-TMP> in 1986 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-ADV> becoming the school 's seventh principal in 15 years </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> Her immediate predecessor </ARG0> <suffer.01>suffered</suffer.01> <ARG1> a nervous breakdown </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> Prior to his term </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> a teacher </ARG1> <bleed.01>bled</bleed.01> <ARGM-PRD> to death </ARGM-PRD> <ARGM-LOC> in the halls </ARGM-LOC> , <ARGM-ADV> stabbed by a student </ARGM-ADV> .
Academically , <ARG0> Mrs. Ward </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> , the school was having trouble serving in harmony its two disparate , and evenly split , student groups : a privileged white elite from old monied neighborhoods and blacks , many of them poor , from run-down , inner city neighborhoods .
<ARG0> Mrs. Ward </ARG0> <resolve.02>resolved</resolve.02> <ARG1> to clean out `` deadwood '' in the school 's faculty and restore safety </ARG1> , and she also had some new factors working in her behalf .
One was statewide school reform , which <raise.01>raised</raise.01> <ARG1> overall educational funding </ARG1> and ushered in a new public spirit for school betterment .
Another was Nancy Yeargin , who <come.01>came</come.01> <ARG4-to> to Greenville </ARG4-to> <ARGM-TMP> in 1985 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-ADV> full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward </ARGM-ADV> .
`` <ARG1> Being a teacher </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> just </ARGM-ADV> <become.01>became</become.01> <ARG2> my life </ARG2> , '' says the 37-year-old Mrs. Yeargin , a teacher for 12 years before her dismissal . ``
<ARG0> I </ARG0> <love.01>loved</love.01> <ARG1> the school , its history </ARG1> .
<ARG0> I </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> even </ARGM-DIS> <dream.01>dreamt</dream.01> about school and new things to do with my students . ''
While <ARG0> Mrs. Ward </ARG0> <fire.02>fired</fire.02> and restructured <ARG1> staff </ARG1> and struggled to improve curriculum , Mrs. Yeargin worked 14-hour days and fast became a student favorite .
<ARGM-TMP> In 1986-87 and 1987-88 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> she </ARG0> <apply.01>applied</apply.01> for and won <ARG1-for> bonus pay </ARG1-for> <ARGM-LOC> under the reform law </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARGM-ADV> Encouraged by Mrs. Ward </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> Mrs. Yeargin </ARG0> <teach.01>taught</teach.01> <ARG2> honor students in the state `` teacher cadet '' program , a reform creation designed to encourage good students to consider teaching as a career </ARG2> .
<ARG0> She </ARG0> <win.01>won</win.01> <ARG1> grant money </ARG1> <ARG2-for> for the school </ARG2-for> , advised cheerleaders , ran the pep club , proposed and taught a new `` Cultural Literacy '' class in Western Civilization and was chosen by the school PTA as `` Teacher of the Year . ''
`` She was an inspirational lady ; <ARG0> she </ARG0> <have.03>had</have.03> <ARG1> it all together </ARG1> , '' says Laura Dobson , a freshman at the University of South Carolina who had Mrs. Yeargin in the teacher-cadet class last year .
<ARG0> She </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> <ARG1> that because of Mrs. Yeargin she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Mary Beth Marchand , a Greenville 11th grader , </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <say.01>says</say.01> Mrs. Yeargin inspired her to go into education .
`` <ARG0> She </ARG0> <teach.01>taught</teach.01> <ARG2> us </ARG2> <ARG1> more in Western Civilization than I 've ever learned in other classes </ARG1> , '' says Kelli Green , a Greenville senior .
In the classroom , <ARG0> students </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> , Mrs. Yeargin distinguished herself by varying teaching approaches -- forcing kids to pair up to complete classroom work or using college-bowl type competitions .
<ARGM-TMP> On weekends </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> she </ARG1> <come.01>came</come.01> <ARG4-to> to work </ARG4-to> <ARGM-PNC> to prepare study plans or sometimes , even to polish the furniture in her classroom </ARGM-PNC> .
`` <ARG0> She </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> just </ARGM-ADV> <ARGM-TMP> never </ARGM-TMP> <give.07>gave</give.07> <ARG1> it </ARG1> up , '' says Mary Marchand , Mary Beth 's mother .
`` <ARG0> You </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> 'd </ARGM-MOD> <see.01>see</see.01> <ARG1> her correcting homework in the stands at a football game </ARG1> . ''
<ARG0> Some fellow teachers </ARG0> , <ARGM-DIS> however </ARGM-DIS> , <view.02>viewed</view.02> <ARG1> Mrs. Yeargin </ARG1> <ARG2-as> as cocky and too yielding to students </ARG2-as> .
<ARG0> Mrs. Ward </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> she often defended her to colleagues who called her a grandstander .
Pressures <begin.01>began</begin.01> to build .
<ARG0> Friends </ARG0> <tell.01>told</tell.01> <ARG2> her </ARG2> she was pushing too hard .
Because of <deteriorate.01>deteriorating</deteriorate.01> <ARG1> hearing </ARG1> , she told colleagues she feared she might not be able to teach much longer .
<ARG0> Mrs. Yeargin 's extra work </ARG0> was <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <help.01>helping</help.01> <ARG1> her earn points in the state 's incentive-bonus program </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Huge gains by her students in 1987 and 1988 </ARG0> <mean.01>meant</mean.01> <ARG1> a total of $ 5,000 in bonuses over two years -- a meaningful addition to her annual salary of $ 23,000 </ARG1> .
<win.01><ARG0></win.01> <ARG1> a bonus </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> for a third year </ARGM-TMP> was n't that important to her , Mrs. Yeargin insists . </ARG0>
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> others at Greenville High </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> she was eager to win -- if not for money , then for pride and recognition .
<ARG0> Mary Elizabeth Ariail , another social-studies teacher , </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> she believed Mrs. Yeargin wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that would n't demand good hearing .
Last March , after <attend.01>attending</attend.01> <ARG1> a teaching seminar </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> in Washington </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> Mrs. Yeargin </ARG0> says she returned to Greenville two days before annual testing feeling that she had n't prepared her low-ability geography students adequately .
<ARGM-TMP> When </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> test booklets </ARG1> were <pass.10>passed</pass.10> out <ARGM-TMP> 48 hours ahead of time </ARGM-TMP> , she says she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students .
<ARG0> Mrs. Yeargin </ARG0> <admit.01>admits</admit.01> she made a big mistake but insists her motives were correct .
`` <ARG0> I </ARG0> was <try.01>trying</try.01> <ARG1> to help kids in an unfair testing situation </ARG1> , '' she says .
The rest were history , sociology , finance -- subjects <ARG0> they </ARG0> <ARGM-NEG> never </ARGM-NEG> <have.03>had</have.03> . ''
<ARG0> Mrs. Yeargin </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> <ARG1> that she also wanted to help lift Greenville High School 's overall test scores , usually near the bottom of 14 district high schools in rankings carried annually by local newspapers </ARG1> .
Mostly , <ARG0> she </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> , she wanted to prevent the damage to self-esteem that her low-ability students would suffer from doing badly on the test .
`` <ARG0> These kids </ARG0> <break.01>broke</break.01> <ARG1> my heart </ARG1> , '' she says .
`` <ARG1> A whole day </ARG1> <go.01>goes</go.01> <ARGM-DIR> by </ARGM-DIR> and no one even knows they 're alive .

The last thing <ARG0> they </ARG0> <need.01>needed</need.01> was another drag-down blow . ''
<ARG0> School officials and prosecutors </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> Mrs. Yeargin is lying .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <find.01>found</find.01> students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help , <ARGM-ADV> although because the case was n't tried in court , this evidence was never presented publicly </ARGM-ADV> .
`` <ARG0> That </ARG0> <ARGM-MNR> pretty much </ARGM-MNR> <defeat.01>defeats</defeat.01> <ARG1> any inkling that she was out to help the poor underprivileged child </ARG1> , '' says Joe Watson , the prosecutor in the case , who is also president of Greenville High School 's alumni association .
<ARG0> Mrs. Yeargin </ARG0> <concede.01>concedes</concede.01> <ARG1> that she went over the questions in the earlier class </ARG1> , <ARGM-ADV> adding : `` I wanted to help all '' students </ARGM-ADV> .

`` Do <ARG0> I </ARG0> <have.03>have</have.03> <ARG1> much sympathy for her </ARG1> ? '' Mr. Watson asks .

<ARG1> What </ARG1> <ARG0> she </ARG0> <do.02>did</do.02> was like taking the law into your own hands . ''
<ARG0> Mrs. Ward </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> <ARG1> that when the cheating was discovered , she wanted to avoid the morale-damaging public disclosure that a trial would bring </ARG1> .
<ARG0> She </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> she offered Mrs. Yeargin a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate .
<ARG0> Mrs. Yeargin </ARG0> <decline.02>declined</decline.02> .

To the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities -- and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests -- <ARG0> Mrs . Yeargin </ARG0> <win.01>won</win.01> <ARG1> widespread local support </ARG1> .
<ARGM-LOC> The school-board hearing at which </ARGM-LOC> <ARG1> she </ARG1> was <dismiss.01>dismissed</dismiss.01> was crowded with students , teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf .
<ARG0> Supportive callers </ARG0> <decry.01>decried</decry.01> <ARG1> unfair testing , not Mrs. Yeargin , </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> on a local radio talk show on which she appeared </ARGM-LOC> .

`` The message to the board of education out of all this is <ARG0> we </ARG0> 've <get.06>got</get.06> <ARG1> to take a serious look at how we 're doing our curriculum and our testing policies in this state </ARG1> , '' said the talk-show host .
<ARG0> Editorials in the Greenville newspaper </ARG0> <allow.03>allowed</allow.03> <ARG1> that Mrs. Yeargin was wrong </ARG1> , but also said the case showed how testing was being overused .
<ARG0> The radio show </ARG0> `` <enrage.01>enraged</enrage.01> <ARG1> us </ARG1> , '' says Mrs. Ward .
Partly because of the show , <ARG0> Mr. Watson </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> , the district decided not to recommend Mrs. Yeargin for a first-time offenders program that could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record .
<ARGM-DIS> And </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> legal authorities </ARG0> <crank.01>cranked</crank.01> up <ARG1> an investigation worthy of a murder case </ARG1> .
<ARG1> Over 50 witnesses , mostly students , </ARG1> were <interview.01>interviewed</interview.01> .
<ARG0> `` It 's hard to <explain.01>explain</explain.01> <ARG2-to> to a 17-year-old </ARG2-to> why someone they like had to go , '' says Mrs. Ward . </ARG0>
<ARGM-TMP> Soon </ARGM-TMP> , T-shirts <appear.01>appeared</appear.01> <ARGM-LOC> in the corridors </ARGM-LOC> that carried the school 's familiar red-and-white GHS logo on the front .
<ARGM-LOC> On the back </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> the shirts </ARG0> <read.01>read</read.01> , `` <ARG1> We have all the answers </ARG1> . ''
`` <ARG0> She </ARG0> <do.02>did</do.02> <ARG1> a lot of harm </ARG1> , '' says Cathryn Rice , who had discovered the crib notes .
`` <ARG0> We </ARG0> <work.01>work</work.01> <ARGM-MNR> damn hard </ARGM-MNR> <ARG1-at> at what we do </ARG1-at> <ARGM-PNC> for damn little pay </ARGM-PNC> , and what she did cast unfair aspersions on all of us . ''
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> several teachers </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <say.01>say</say.01> the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores .
<say.01>Says</say.01> <ARG0> Gayle Key , a mathematics teacher , </ARG0> `` <ARG1> The incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms </ARG1> .
There may be <ARG0> others </ARG0> <do.02>doing</do.02> <ARG1> what she did </ARG1> . ''
<ARG0> Mrs. Yeargin </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> she pleaded guilty because she realized it would no longer be possible to win reinstatement , and because she was afraid of further charges .
Despite the strong evidence against Mrs. Yeargin , popular sentiment was so strong in her favor , <ARG0> Mrs. Ward </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> , that `` I 'm afraid a jury would n't have convicted her .
Since <ARG0> chalk </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> first </ARGM-TMP> <touch.01>touched</touch.01> <ARG1> slate </ARG1> , schoolchildren have wanted to know : What 's on the test ?
<ARGM-TMP> These days </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> students </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-TMP> often </ARGM-TMP> <find.01>find</find.01> <ARG1> the answer </ARG1> in test-coaching workbooks and worksheets their teachers give them in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests .
<ARG0> The mathematics section of the widely used California Achievement Test </ARG0> <ask.01>asks</ask.01> <ARG2> fifth graders </ARG2> : `` <ARG1> What is another name for the Roman numeral IX ? </ARG1> ''
<ARG0> It </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <ask.02>asks</ask.02> <ARG2> them </ARG2> <ARG1> to add two-sevenths and three-sevenths </ARG1> .
Worksheets in <ARG1> a test-practice kit </ARG1> <call.01>called</call.01> <ARG2> Learning Materials </ARG2> , sold to schools across the country by Macmillan\/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. , contain the same questions .
What 's more , <ARG1> the test and Learning Materials </ARG1> are <ARGM-ADV> both </ARGM-ADV> <produce.01>produced</produce.01> <ARG0-by> by the same company , Macmillan\/McGraw-Hill , a joint venture of McGraw-Hill Inc. and Macmillan 's parent , Britain 's Maxwell Communication Corp </ARG0-by> .
<ARG1> Close parallels between tests and practice tests are common </ARG1> , <ARG0> some educators and researchers </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> .
Test-preparation booklets , software and worksheets are a <boom.02>booming</boom.02> <ARG0> publishing subindustry </ARG0> .
But some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that <ARG0> critics </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> they represent a form of school-sponsored cheating .
`` If <ARG0> I </ARG0> <take.01>took</take.01> -LCB- <ARG1> these preparation booklets </ARG1> -RCB- <ARGM-DIR> into my classroom </ARGM-DIR> , I 'd have a hard time justifying to my students and parents that it was n't cheating , '' says John Kaminski , a Traverse City , Mich. , teacher who has studied test coaching .
<ARG0> He and other critics </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests , which is to gauge learning progress .
`` It 's as if <ARG0> France </ARG0> <decide.01>decided</decide.01> <ARG1> to give only French history questions to students in a European history class </ARG1> , and when everybody aces the test , they say their kids are good in European history , '' says John Cannell , an Albuquerque , N.M. , psychiatrist and founder of an educational research organization , Friends for Education , which has studied standardized testing .
<ARG1> Standardized achievement tests </ARG1> are <give.01>given</give.01> <ARGM-TMP> about 10 million times a year </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-LOC> across the country </ARGM-LOC> <ARG2-to> to students generally from kindergarten through eighth grade </ARG2-to> .
<ARGM-LOC> In Arizona , California , Florida , Louisiana , Maryland , New Jersey , South Carolina and Texas </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> educators </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> they are common classroom tools .
<ARG0> Macmillan\/McGraw </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> `` well over 10 million '' of its Scoring High test-preparation books have been sold since their introduction 10 years ago , with most sales in the last five years .
<ARG1> About 20,000 sets of Learning Materials teachers ' binders </ARG1> have <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> been <sell.01>sold</sell.01> <ARGM-TMP> in the past four years </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> The materials in each set </ARG0> <reach.01>reach</reach.01> <ARG1> about 90 students </ARG1> .
Michael Kean , director of marketing for CTB Macmillan\/McGraw , <ARG0> the Macmillan\/McGraw division that </ARG0> <publish.01>publishes</publish.01> <ARG1> Learning Materials </ARG1> , says it is n't aimed at improving test scores .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <assert.03>asserted</assert.03> <ARG1> that exact questions were n't replicated </ARG1> .
When <refer.02>referred</refer.02> <ARG2-to> to the questions that matched </ARG2-to> , <ARG1> he </ARG1> said it was coincidental .
<ARG0> Mr. Kaminski , the schoolteacher , and William Mehrens , a Michigan State University education professor , </ARG0> <conclude.01>concluded</conclude.01> <ARGM-LOC> in a study </ARGM-LOC> <ARGM-TMP> last June </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> that CAT test versions of Scoring High and Learning Materials should n't be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test </ARG1> .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <devise.01>devised</devise.01> <ARG1> a 69-point scale </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> -- awarding one point for each subskill measured on the CAT test -- </ARGM-ADV> <ARGM-PNC> to rate the closeness of test preparatives to the fifth-grade CAT </ARGM-PNC> .
Because many of these subskills -- the symmetry of geometrical figures , metric measurement of volume , or pie and bar graphs , for example -- are only a small part of the total fifth-grade curriculum , <ARG0> Mr. Kaminski </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> , the preparation kits would n't replicate too many , if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG1> Learning Materials </ARG1> <match.01>matched</match.01> <ARGM-LOC> on 66.5 of 69 subskills </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG1> Scoring High </ARG1> <match.01>matched</match.01> <ARGM-LOC> on 64.5 </ARGM-LOC> .
In <ARGM-LOC> CAT sections where </ARGM-LOC> <ARG1> students ' knowledge of two-letter consonant sounds </ARG1> is <test.01>tested</test.01> , the authors noted that Scoring High concentrated on the same sounds that the test does -- to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth graders should know .
<ARG0> Learning Materials for the fifth-grade </ARG0> <contain.01>contains</contain.01> <ARG1> at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Rick Brownell , senior editor of Scoring High , </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> that Messrs. Kaminski and Mehrens are ignoring `` the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format . ''
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> authors of Scoring High `` scrupulously avoid '' replicating exact questions , but he does n't deny that some items are similar .
<ARGM-TMP> When </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> Scoring High </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> first </ARGM-TMP> <come.09>came</come.09> out <ARGM-TMP> in 1979 </ARGM-TMP> , it was a publication of Random House .
<ARGM-LOC> In a 1985 advisory to educators </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> McGraw-Hill </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> Scoring High should n't be used because it represented a `` parallel form '' of the CAT and CTBS tests .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARGM-TMP> in 1988 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> McGraw-Hill </ARG0> <purchase.01>purchased</purchase.01> <ARG1> the Random House unit that publishes Scoring High , which later became part of Macmillan\/McGraw </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Messrs. Brownell and Kean </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> they are unaware of any efforts by McGraw-Hill to modify or discontinue Scoring High .
<ARG0> Alleghany Corp. </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it completed the acquisition of Sacramento Savings & Loan Association from the H.N. & Frances C. Berger Foundation for $ 150 million .
The Sacramento-based S&L , which <have.03>has</have.03> <ARG1> 44 branch offices </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> in north central California </ARGM-LOC> , had assets of $ 2.4 billion at the end of September .
<ARG2> The purchase price </ARG2> <include.01>includes</include.01> <ARG1> two ancillary companies </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The Department of Health and Human Services </ARG0> <plan.01>plans</plan.01> <ARG1> to extend its moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal-tissue transplants </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Medical researchers </ARG0> <believe.01>believe</believe.01> the transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help treat juvenile diabetes and such degenerative diseases as Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's and Huntington 's .
But <ARG0> anti-abortionists </ARG0> <oppose.01>oppose</oppose.01> <ARG1> such research </ARG1> <ARGM-CAU> because they worry that the development of therapies using fetal-tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions </ARGM-CAU> .
<ARG0> James Mason , assistant secretary for health , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the ban on federal funding of fetal-tissue transplant research `` should be continued indefinitely . ''
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the ban wo n't stop privately funded tissue-transplant research or federally funded fetal-tissue research that does n't involve transplants .
<ARG0> Department officials </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> <ARG1> that HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan will support Dr. Mason 's ruling , which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the National Institutes of Health </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Both Dr. Mason and Dr. Sullivan </ARG0> <oppose.01>oppose</oppose.01> <ARG1> federal funding for abortion </ARG1> , <ARGM-ADV> as does President Bush </ARGM-ADV> , <ARGM-ADV> except in cases where a woman 's life is threatened </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG1> The controversy </ARG1> <begin.01>began</begin.01> <ARGM-TMP> in 1987 </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-TMP> when the National Institutes of Health , aware of the policy implications of its research , asked for an HHS review of its plan to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from Parkinson 's disease </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> The department </ARG0> <place.01>placed</place.01> <ARG1> a moratorium </ARG1> <ARG2-on> on the research </ARG2-on> , <ARGM-ADV> pending a review of scientific , legal and ethical issues </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> A majority of an NIH-appointed panel </ARG0> <recommend.01>recommended</recommend.01> <ARGM-TMP> late last year </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions </ARG1> , but the issue became embroiled in politics as anti-abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding .
<ARG0> The dispute </ARG0> has <hamper.01>hampered</hamper.01> the administration 's efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control .
<ARG0> Several candidates </ARG0> have <withdraw.01>withdrawn</withdraw.01> <ARG1> their names </ARG1> <ARG2-from> from consideration </ARG2-from> <ARGM-TMP> after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal-tissue transplants </ARGM-TMP> .
Antonio Novello , whom <ARG0> Mr. Bush </ARG0> <nominate.01>nominated</nominate.01> <ARG2> to serve as surgeon general </ARG2> , reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion .
<ARG0> Some researchers </ARG0> have <charge.06>charged</charge.06> <ARG1> that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> Earlier this week </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Dr. Sullivan </ARG0> <try.01>tried</try.01> to defuse these charges by stressing that candidates to head the NIH and the CDC will be judged by `` standards of scientific and administrative excellence , '' not politics .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> the administration 's handling of the fetal-tissue transplant issue </ARG0> <disturb.01>disturbs</disturb.01> <ARG1> many scientists </ARG1> .
`` <ARGM-TMP> When </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> scientific progress </ARG1> <move.01>moves</move.01> <ARG2-into> into uncharted ground </ARG2-into> , there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications , '' says Myron Genel , associate dean of the Yale Medical School .
`` The disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that <ARG1> the debate </ARG1> has <become.01>become</become.01> <ARG2> polarized , so that no mechanism exists '' for finding a middle ground </ARG2> .
Yale is one of <ARG0> the few medical institutions </ARG0> <conduct.01>conducting</conduct.01> <ARG1> privately funded research on fetal-tissue transplants </ARG1> .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> Dr. Genel </ARG0> <warn.01>warns</warn.01> <ARG1> that Dr. Mason 's ruling may discourage private funding </ARG1> .
`` The unavailability of federal funds , and <ARGM-LOC> the climate in which </ARGM-LOC> <ARG1> the decision </ARG1> was <make.01>made</make.01> , certainly do n't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support , '' he said .
Despite the flap over transplants , federal funding of <ARG2> research </ARG2> <involve.01>involving</involve.01> <ARG1> fetal tissues </ARG1> will continue on a number of fronts .
`` <ARG1> Such research </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> may </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-TMP> ultimately </ARGM-TMP> <result.01>result</result.01> <ARG2-in> in the ability to regenerate damaged tissues or to turn off genes that cause cancer '' or to regulate genes that cause Down 's syndrome , the leading cause of mental retardation , according to an NIH summary </ARG2-in> .
<ARG0> The NIH </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> currently </ARGM-TMP> <spend.01>spends</spend.01> <ARG3> about $ 8 million </ARG3> <ARGM-TMP> annually </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1-on> on fetal-tissue research </ARG1-on> <ARGM-ADV> out of a total research budget of $ 8 billion </ARGM-ADV> .
<rekindle.01>Rekindled</rekindle.01> <ARG1> hope </ARG1> that two New England states will allow broader interstate banking boosted Nasdaq 's bank stocks , but the over-the-counter market was up only slightly in lackluster trading .
<ARG1> The Nasdaq composite index </ARG1> <add.03>added</add.03> <ARG2-EXT> 1.01 </ARG2-EXT> <ARG4-to> to 456.64 </ARG4-to> <ARGM-ADV> on paltry volume of 118.6 million shares </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARGM-TMP> In October , the busiest month of the year so far , </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> daily volume </ARG1> <average.01>averaged</average.01> <ARG2> roughly 145 million shares </ARG2> .
<ARG1> The Nasdaq 100 index of the biggest nonfinancial stocks </ARG1> <gain.01>gained</gain.01> <ARG2-EXT> 1.39 </ARG2-EXT> <ARG4-to> to 446.62 </ARG4-to> .
<ARG1> The index of the 100 largest Nasdaq financial stocks </ARG1> <rise.01>rose</rise.01> <ARGM-MNR> modestly </ARGM-MNR> <ARGM-DIS> as well </ARGM-DIS> , <ARGM-ADV> gaining 1.28 to 449.04 </ARGM-ADV> .
But the broader Nasdaq bank index , which <track.01>tracks</track.01> <ARG1> thrift issues </ARG1> , jumped 3.23 to 436.01 .
<ARG0> The bank stocks </ARG0> <get.01>got</get.01> <ARG1> a boost </ARG1> when Connecticut Bank & Trust and Bank of New England said they no longer oppose pending legislation that would permit banks from other regions to merge with Connecticut and Massachusetts banks .
<ARG1> The two banks </ARG1> <merge.01>merged</merge.01> <ARGM-TMP> in 1985 </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG1> Bank of New England 's shares </ARG1> are <trade.01>traded</trade.01> <ARGM-LOC> on the New York Stock Exchange </ARGM-LOC> .
The stocks of <bank.01>banking</bank.01> <ARG2> concerns </ARG2> based in Massachusetts were n't helped much by the announcement , traders said , because many of those concerns have financial problems tied to their real-estate loan portfolios , making them unattractive takeover targets .
But <ARG0> speculators </ARG0> , <anticipate.01>anticipating</anticipate.01> <ARG1> that Connecticut will approve a law permitting such interstate banking soon </ARG1> , immediately bid up shares of Connecticut banks on the news .
`` <ARG0> A lot of the stocks that have been under water </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> finally </ARGM-TMP> <see.01>saw</see.01> a reason to uptick , '' said George Jennison , head trader of banking issues in Shearson Lehman Hutton 's OTC department .
The biggest beneficiary was Northeast Bancorp , which <surge.01>surged</surge.01> <ARG2-EXT> 7 3\/4 </ARG2-EXT> <ARG4-to> to 69 </ARG4-to> .
<ARG0> The Stamford , Conn. , concern </ARG0> has <agree.01>agreed</agree.01> <ARG1-to> to a buy-out by Bank of New York </ARG1-to> <ARGM-LOC> in a transaction with an indicated value of about $ 100 a share that expires next August </ARGM-LOC> .
Ed Macheski , <ARG0> a Wilton , Conn. , money manager who </ARG0> <follow.02>follows</follow.02> <ARG1> bank stocks </ARG1> , said the announcement effectively gives the deal `` the green light . ''
<ARG0> Mr. Jennison </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> Northeast Bancorp also fared well because takeover stocks have returned to favor among investors .
<ARG1> Another OTC bank stock </ARG1> <involve.01>involved</involve.01> <ARG2-in> in a buy-out deal </ARG2-in> , First Constitution Financial , was higher .
<ARG1> It </ARG1> <rise.01>rose</rise.01> <ARG2-EXT> 7\/8 </ARG2-EXT> <ARG4-to> to 18 1\/4 </ARG4-to> .
<ARG0> First Constitution </ARG0> has <sign.02>signed</sign.02> a merger agreement <ARG2-with> with WFRR L.P. and GHKM Corp. </ARG2-with> , under which all of its common shares will be acquired for $ 25 each , or $ 273.5 million .
Among other Connecticut banks <ARG1> whose shares </ARG1> <trade.01>trade</trade.01> <ARGM-LOC> in the OTC market </ARGM-LOC> , Society for Savings Bancorp , based in Hartford , saw its stock rise 1 3\/4 to 18 1\/4 .

<ARG0> The Pennsylvania bank </ARG0> <agree.01>agreed</agree.01> <ARG1> to be acquired in a merger with Univest Corp. of Pennsylvania for $ 25.50 a share </ARG1> .

<ARG0> Dan E. Nelms , Valley Federal 's president and chief executive officer , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the one-time charge substantially eliminates future losses associated with the unit .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the company 's core business remains strong .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that after the charges , and `` assuming no dramatic fluctuation in interest rates , the company expects to achieve near-record earnings in 1990 </ARG1> . ''

<ARG1> The IRS warnings </ARG1> <stem.01>stem</stem.01> <ARG2-from> from a 1984 law that requires anyone who receives more than $ 10,000 in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions `` in the course of trade or business '' to report the payment on a document known as Form 8300 </ARG2-from> .
<ARG0> The form </ARG0> <ask.02>asks</ask.02> <ARG1-for> for such details as the client 's name , Social Security number , passport number and details about the services provided for the payment </ARG1-for> .
<ARG0> Failure to <complete.01>complete</complete.01> <ARG1> the form </ARG1> had been punishable as a misdemeanor until last November , when Congress determined that the crime was a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison . </ARG0>
<ARG0> Attorneys </ARG0> have <argue.01>argued</argue.01> <ARGM-TMP> since 1985 , when the law took effect </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> that they can not provide information about clients who do n't wish their identities to be known </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Many attorneys </ARG0> have <return.02>returned</return.02> <ARG1> incomplete forms </ARG1> <ARG2-to> to the IRS </ARG2-to> <ARGM-TMP> in recent years </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-ADV> citing attorney-client privilege </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARGM-TMP> Until last week </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> the IRS </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> rarely </ARGM-TMP> <act.02>acted</act.02> <ARG1-on> on the incomplete forms </ARG1-on> .
`` <ARG0> This form </ARG0> <force.01>forces</force.01> <ARG1> a lawyer </ARG1> <ARG2> to become , in effect , a witness against his client </ARG2> , '' said Neal R. Sonnett , president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers .
`` <ARG0> The IRS </ARG0> is <ask.02>asking</ask.02> <ARG2> lawyers </ARG2> <ARG1> to red-flag a criminal problem to the government </ARG1> , '' added Mr. Sonnett , a Miami lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the computer-generated IRS forms sent by certified mail .
<ARG0> Mr. Sonnett </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who do n't have domestic bank accounts </ARG1> .
These individuals may not necessarily be under investigation <ARGM-TMP> when </ARGM-TMP> <ARG0> they </ARG0> <hire.01>hire</hire.01> <ARG1> lawyers </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Mr. Sonnett </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> there also may be other circumstances under which individuals would n't want the government to know they had retained criminal defense lawyers .
<fill.04><ARG0></fill.04> out <ARG1> detailed forms about these individuals </ARG1> would tip the IRS off and spark action against the clients , he said . </ARG0>
<ARG0> The defense lawyers ' group </ARG0> <form.01>formed</form.01> a task force <ARGM-TMP> this week </ARGM-TMP> , chaired by New York attorney Gerald Lefcourt , to deal with the matter .
<ARG0> The American Bar Association 's House of Delegates </ARG0> <pass.01>passed</pass.01> a resolution <ARGM-TMP> in 1985 </ARGM-TMP> condemning the IRS reporting requirement .
Michael Ross , <ARG0> a New York lawyer who </ARG0> <head.01>heads</head.01> <ARG1> the ABA 's grand jury committee </ARG1> , said that lawyers are prohibited by the ABA 's code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death .
<ARG0> Mr. Ross </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> he met with officials of the IRS and the Justice Department , which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers , to discuss the issue last May .
At that meeting , <ARG0> he </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> , the Justice Department assured him that enforcement procedures would n't be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice .
<ARG0> Mr. Ross </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> IRS officials opposed the Justice Department 's moderate stance on the matter .
But in <ARG1> the letters </ARG1> <send.01>sent</send.01> <ARGM-TMP> in recent days </ARGM-TMP> , Christopher J. Lezovich of the IRS computing center in Detroit , told attorneys that `` failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated . ''
<ARGM-LOC> In some cases </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> the IRS </ARG0> <ask.02>asked</ask.02> for information dating back to forms it received in 1985 .
<ARG0> A spokesman for the IRS </ARG0> <confirm.01>confirmed</confirm.01> <ARG1> that `` there has been correspondence mailed about incomplete 8300s </ARG1> , '' but he declined to say why the letters were sent to lawyers now .
<ARG0> Individuals familiar with the Justice Department 's policy </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that Justice officials had n't any knowledge of the IRS 's actions in the last week </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Lawyers </ARG0> <worry.01>worry</worry.01> <ARG1> that if they provide information about clients , that data could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Prosecutors </ARG0> <need.01>need</need.01> <ARG1> court permission </ARG1> <ARGM-PNC> to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business </ARGM-PNC> .
But <ARG0> they </ARG0> have <obtain.01>obtained</obtain.01> <ARG1> 8300 forms </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> without court permission </ARGM-MNR> and used the information to help develop criminal cases .
<ARG0> Some criminal lawyers </ARG0> <speculate.01>speculated</speculate.01> <ARG1> that the IRS was sending the letters to test the issue </ARG1> .
<ARGM-LOC> In a number of recent cases </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> federal courts </ARG0> have <refuse.01>refused</refuse.01> <ARG1> to recognize attorneys ' assertions that information relating to fees from clients should be confidential </ARG1> .
<ARG0> THE WAR OVER FEDERAL JUDICIAL SALARIES </ARG0> <take.01>takes</take.01> <ARG1> a victim </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> Often </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> judges </ARG1> <ease.03>ease</ease.03> <ARG4-into> into more lucrative private practice </ARG4-into> <ARGM-MNR> with little fanfare </ARGM-MNR> , but not federal Judge Raul A. Ramirez in Sacramento , Calif .
<ARGM-TMP> On Tuesday </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> the judge </ARG0> <call.03>called</call.03> <ARG1> a news conference </ARG1> to say he was quitting effective Dec. 31 to join a San Francisco law firm .
The reason : the refusal of <ARG0> Congress </ARG0> to <give.01>give</give.01> <ARG2> federal judges </ARG2> <ARG1> a raise </ARG1> .
`` A couple of my law clerks were <go.04>going</go.04> to pass me in three or four years , and I was afraid I was going to have to ask them for a loan , '' the judge quipped in an interview .
<ARG0> Federal judges </ARG0> <make.05>make</make.05> <ARG1> $ 89,500 </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> annually </ARGM-TMP> ; in February , Congress rejected a bill that would have increased their pay by 50 % .
<ARG0> Judge Ramirez , 44 , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it is unjust for judges to make what they do .
`` <ARG0> Judges </ARG0> are <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> <get.01>getting</get.01> <ARG1> what they deserve </ARG1> .
<ARG0> You </ARG0> <look.01>look</look.01> <ARGM-DIR> around </ARGM-DIR> <ARG1-at> at professional ballplayers or accountants </ARG1-at> ... and nobody blinks an eye .
<ARGM-TMP> When </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> you </ARG1> <become.01>become</become.01> <ARG2> a federal judge </ARG2> , all of a sudden you are relegated to a paltry sum . ''
At his new job , as partner in charge of federal litigation in the Sacramento office of Orrick , Herrington & Sutcliffe , <ARG1> he </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <make.15>make</make.15> out <ARGM-MNR> much better </ARGM-MNR> .
<ARG0> The judge </ARG0> <decline.02>declined</decline.02> <ARG1> to discuss his salary in detail </ARG1> , but said : `` I 'm going to be a high-priced lawyer . ''
<ARG0> Cartoonist Garry Trudeau </ARG0> is <sue.01>suing</sue.01> <ARG1> the Writers Guild of America East </ARG1> <ARG3-for> for $ 11 million </ARG3-for> , alleging it mounted a `` campaign to harass and punish '' him for crossing a screenwriters ' picket line .
<ARG2> The dispute </ARG2> <involve.01>involves</involve.01> <ARG1> Darkhorse Productions Inc. , a TV production company in which Mr. Trudeau is a co-owner </ARG1> .
<ARG1> Mr. Trudeau , a Writers Guild member , </ARG1> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> was <employ.01>employed</employ.01> <ARG2-as> as a writer for Darkhorse , which was covered by a guild collective-bargaining agreement </ARG2-as> .
<ARG0> The guild </ARG0> <begin.01>began</begin.01> <ARG1> a strike against the TV and movie industry </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> in March 1988 </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARGM-LOC> In his lawsuit </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> Mr. Trudeau </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> the strike illegally included Darkhorse , and the cartoonist refused to honor the strike against the company .
<ARG0> A spokesman for the guild </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the union 's lawyers are reviewing the suit .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> disciplinary proceedings are confidential and declined to comment on whether any are being held against Mr. Trudeau .
<ARG0> Mr. Trudeau 's attorney , Norman K. Samnick , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the harassment consists mainly of the guild 's year-long threats of disciplinary action .
<ARG0> Mr. Samnick </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> a guild disciplinary hearing is scheduled next Monday in New York .
Mr. Samnick , who <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <go.XX>go</go.XX> <ARG4-before> before the disciplinary panel </ARG4-before> , said the proceedings are unfair and that any punishment from the guild would be unjustified .
<ARGM-ADV> In addition to the damages </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> the suit </ARG0> <seek.01>seeks</seek.01> <ARG1> a court order preventing the guild from punishing or retaliating against Mr. Trudeau </ARG1> .
<ARG1> ABORTION RULING </ARG1> <uphold.01>UPHELD</uphold.01> :
<ARG0> A federal appeals court </ARG0> <uphold.01>upheld</uphold.01> <ARG1> a lower court ruling that the U.S. can bar the use of federal funds for family-planning programs that include abortion-related services </ARG1> .
<ARG1> A Department of Health and Human Services rule </ARG1> <adopt.01>adopted</adopt.01> <ARGM-TMP> in 1988 </ARGM-TMP> prohibits the use of so-called Title X funds for programs that assist a woman in obtaining an abortion , such as abortion counseling and referrals .
<ARG0> The rule </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <prohibit.01>prohibits</prohibit.01> <ARG1> funding for activities that `` encourage , promote or advocate abortion </ARG1> . ''
<ARG0> The panel </ARG0> <rule.01>ruled</rule.01> <ARG1> that the restrictions do n't violate the freedom of speech of health care providers and that the limits on counseling services do n't violate the rights of pregnant women </ARG1> .
<ARG0> INQUIRY </ARG0> <clear.01>CLEARS</clear.01> <ARG1> TEXAS JUDGE </ARG1> <ARG2-of> of bias </ARG2-of> <ARGM-LOC> in comments on homosexual murder victims </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG0> Dallas District Judge Jack Hampton </ARG0> had <spark.01>sparked</spark.01> <ARG1> calls for a judicial inquiry </ARG1> <ARG2-with> with his remarks to the press </ARG2-with> <ARGM-TMP> last December </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-TMP> two weeks after sentencing an 18-year-old defendant to 30 years in state prison for killing two homosexual men in a city park </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG1> The judge </ARG1> was <quote.01>quoted</quote.01> as referring to the victims as `` queers '' and saying they would n't have been killed `` if they had n't been cruising the streets picking up teenage boys . ''
But Robert R. Murray , <ARG1> a special master </ARG1> <appoint.01>appointed</appoint.01> <ARG0-by> by the Texas Supreme Court </ARG0-by> , said Judge Hampton did n't breach any judicial standards of fairness , although he did violate the state 's judicial code by commenting publicly on a pending case .
<observe.02>Observing</observe.02> <ARG1> that the judge `` has never exhibited any bias or prejudice </ARG1> , '' <ARG0> Mr. Murray </ARG0> concluded that he `` would be impartial in any case involving a homosexual or prostitute '' as a victim .
<ARG0> Mr. Murray </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <say.01>said</say.01> Judge Hampton 's comments did n't discredit the judiciary or the administration of justice .
The report is subject to review by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct , which is <empower.01>empowered</empower.01> <ARG2> to impose sanctions </ARG2> .
<ARG1> GAF TRIAL </ARG1> <go.06>goes</go.06> <ARG2-to> to round three </ARG2-to> .

<ARG0> The tire maker </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the buildings consist of 1.8 million square feet of office , manufacturing and warehousing space on 353 acres of land .
<ARG0> Fujitsu Ltd.

<ARGM-TMP> Meanwhile </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> business and government leaders </ARG0> <rebuke.01>rebuked</rebuke.01> <ARG1> the computer makers </ARG1> , and fretted about the broader statement the companies ' actions make about Japanese cutthroat pricing .
<ARG0> Fujitsu </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it bid the equivalent of less than a U.S. penny on three separate municipal contracts during the past two years .
<ARG0> The company </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> also </ARGM-ADV> <disclose.01>disclosed</disclose.01> <ARG1> that during that period it offered 10,000 yen , or about $ 70 , for another contract </ARG1> .
<ARG0> NEC , one of its largest domestic competitors , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it bid one yen in two separate public auctions since 1987 .
<ARGM-LOC> In both cases </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> NEC </ARG0> <lose.02>lost</lose.02> <ARG1> the contract </ARG1> <ARG2-to> to Fujitsu , which made the same bid and won a tie-breaking lottery </ARG2-to> .
<ARG2> All the contracts </ARG2> were for computer-system-design contracts and <involve.01>involved</involve.01> <ARG1> no hardware or software </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The Ministry of International Trade and Industry </ARG0> <summon.01>summoned</summon.01> <ARG1> executives from the companies </ARG1> to `` make sure they understood '' the concern about such practices , according to a government spokesman .
`` <ARG0> These cases </ARG0> <lead.03>lead</lead.03> <ARG2-to> to the loss of the firms ' social and international credibility </ARG2-to> , '' a ministry statement said .
<ARG0> Japan 's Fair Trade Commission </ARG0> has <say.01>said</say.01> it is considering investigating the bids for possible antitrust-law violations .
`` <ARG0> We </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <like.02>like</like.02> <ARG1> to apologize for having caused huge trouble </ARG1> , '' Fujitsu President Takuma Yamamoto , read from a prepared statement as he stood before a packed news conference at his company 's downtown headquarters .

<ARG0> NEC </ARG0> <release.01>released</release.01> <ARG1> a statement saying , `` We feel sorry for having caused trouble to society , '' a form of apology common in Japan for companies caught in embarrassing situations </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Japanese companies </ARG0> have <ARGM-TMP> long </ARGM-TMP> <have.03>had</have.03> <ARG1> a reputation for sacrificing short-term profits to make a sale that may have long-term benefits </ARG1> .
But the <grow.01>growing</grow.01> <ARG1> controversy </ARG1> comes as many practices historically accepted as normal here -- such as politicians accepting substantial gifts from businessmen or having extramarital affairs -- are coming under close ethical scrutiny .
<ARG1> The fire </ARG1> is <ARGM-ADV> also </ARGM-ADV> <fuel.01>fueled</fuel.01> <ARG2-by> by growing international interest in Japanese behavior </ARG2-by> .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARGM-LOC> in one of the auctions in question </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> International Business Machines Corp. </ARG0> <make.03>made</make.03> <ARG1> a bid substantially higher than the Fujitsu offer </ARG1> , according to the municipality .
<ARG0> The low-ball bids </ARG0> <touch.04>touch</touch.04> <ARG1-on> on issues central to the increasingly tense trade debate </ARG1-on> .
<ARG0> Foreigners </ARG0> <complain.01>complain</complain.01> <ARG1> that they have limited access to government procurement in Japan , in part because Japanese companies unfairly undercut them </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The U.S. government </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> in recent years </ARGM-TMP> has <accuse.01>accused</accuse.01> <ARG1> Japanese companies </ARG1> of excessively slashing prices on semiconductors and supercomputers -- products Fujitsu and NEC make .
<ask.01>Asked</ask.01> <ARG1> whether the bidding flap would hurt U.S.-Japan relations </ARG1> , <ARG0> Mr. Yamamoto </ARG0> said , `` this will be a minus factor . ''
<ARG1> The `` one-yen '' controversy </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> first </ARGM-TMP> <come.04>came</come.04> <ARG2-to> to a head </ARG2-to> <ARGM-TMP> last week </ARGM-TMP> when the city of Hiroshima announced that Fujitsu won a contract to design a computer system to map its waterworks .
<ARG0> The city </ARG0> had <expect.01>expected</expect.01> <ARG1> to pay about 11 million yen -LRB- $ 77,000 -RRB- </ARG1> , but Fujitsu essentially offered to do it for free .
<ARGM-DIS> Then </ARGM-DIS> <ARGM-TMP> Wednesday </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Fujitsu </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it made a similar bid to win a library contract in Nagano prefecture two weeks earlier .

<ARG0> The company </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it has offered to withdraw its bids in Hiroshima and Nagano .
<ARG0> The municipalities </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> they have n't decided whether to try to force the company to go through with the contracts .
<ARG0> Fujitsu and NEC </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> they were still investigating , and that knowledge of more such bids could emerge .
<ARG0> Mr. Yamamoto </ARG0> <insist.01>insisted</insist.01> <ARG1> that headquarters had n't approved the bids , and that he did n't know about most of the cases until Wednesday </ARG1> .
<ARG1> Other major Japanese computer companies </ARG1> <contact.01>contacted</contact.01> <ARGM-TMP> yesterday </ARGM-TMP> said they have never made such bids .

`` <ARGM-DIS> In addition </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> recent industry forecasts for 1990 </ARG0> <indicate.01>indicate</indicate.01> <ARG1> a slow environment , at least until midyear </ARG1> . ''
<ARGM-CAU> As a result </ARGM-CAU> , <ARG0> the company </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it decided to phase out its oldest capacity and `` make appropriate reductions '' in operating expenses .
<ARG1> The $ 35.7 million net loss </ARG1> <equal.01>equals</equal.01> <ARG2> 86 cents a share </ARG2> .
<ARGM-NEG> Not </ARGM-NEG> <count.02>counting</count.02> <ARG1> the extraordinary charge </ARG1> , <ARG0> the company </ARG0> said it would have had a net loss of $ 3.1 million , or seven cents a share .
<ARGM-TMP> A year earlier </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> it </ARG0> <have.03>had</have.03> <ARG1> profit of $ 7.5 million , or 18 cents a share </ARG1> .
<ARG1> Revenue </ARG1> <rise.01>rose</rise.01> <ARG2-EXT> 42 % </ARG2-EXT> <ARG4-to> to $ 133.7 million </ARG4-to> <ARG3-from> from $ 94 million </ARG3-from> .
<ARG2> The charge </ARG2> <ARGM-MNR> partly </ARGM-MNR> <reflect.01>reflects</reflect.01> <ARG1> a switch from older five-inch to more-efficient six-inch silicon wafers with which to fabricate chips </ARG1> .
<relate.01><ARG1></relate.01> <ARG2-to> to that decision </ARG2-to> , the company said it was converting its Santa Clara , Calif. , factory to a research and development facility . </ARG1>
<ARG0> A spokesman </ARG0> <decline.02>declined</decline.02> <ARG1> to speculate about possible reductions in force </ARG1> .
`` This is <ARG0> a company that </ARG0> has <invest.01>invested</invest.01> <ARG2-in> in capacity additions </ARG2-in> <ARGM-MNR> more aggressively than any other company in the industry </ARGM-MNR> and now the industry is growing more slowly and they are suddenly poorly positioned , '' said Michael Stark , chip analyst at Robertson , Stephens & Co .
`` <ARG0> I </ARG0> <think.01>think</think.01> the stock is dead money for a while . ''
<ARG1> Yesterday 's announcement </ARG1> was <make.XX>made</make.XX> <ARGM-TMP> after markets closed </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> U.S. chip makers </ARG0> are <face.01>facing</face.01> <ARG1> continued slack demand </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> following a traditionally slow summer </ARGM-TMP> .
Part of the problem is that <ARG0> chip buyers </ARG0> are <keep.02>keeping</keep.02> <ARG1> inventories low </ARG1> <ARGM-CAU> because of jitters about the course of the U.S. economy </ARGM-CAU> .
<ARG1> William G. Kuhns , former chairman and chief executive officer of General Public Utilities Corp. , </ARG1> was <elect.01>elected</elect.01> <ARG2> a director of this maker of industrial and construction equipment </ARG2> , <ARGM-ADV> increasing board membership to 10 </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> The dollar </ARG0> <post.01>posted</post.01> <ARG1> gains against all major currencies </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> yesterday </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-ADV> buoyed by persistent Japanese demand for U.S. bond issues </ARGM-ADV> .
While <ARG1> market sentiment </ARG1> <remain.01>remains</remain.01> <ARG3> cautiously bearish on the dollar </ARG3> <ARGM-ADV> based on sluggish U.S. economic indicators </ARGM-ADV> , dealers note that Japanese demand has helped underpin the dollar against the yen and has kept the U.S. currency from plunging below key levels against the mark .
<ARGM-TMP> At the same time </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> dealers </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the U.S. unit has been locked into a relatively narrow range in recent weeks , in part because the hefty Japanese demand for dollars has been offset by the mark 's strength , resulting in a stalemate .
<ARG0> Jay Goldinger , with Capital Insight Inc. , </ARG0> <reason.01>reasons</reason.01> <ARG1> that while the mark has posted significant gains against the yen as well -- the mark climbed to 77.70 yen from 77.56 yen late Tuesday in New York -- the strength of the U.S. bond market compared to its foreign counterparts has helped lure investors to dollar-denominated bonds , rather than mark bonds </ARG1> .
`` Dollar-yen -LCB- trade -RCB- is the <drive.02>driving</drive.02> <ARG0> force </ARG0> <ARGM-LOC> in the market </ARGM-LOC> , '' said Tom Trettien , a vice president with Banque Paribas in New York , `` but I 'm not convinced it will continue .

<ARGM-LOC> In late New York trading </ARGM-LOC> <ARGM-TMP> yesterday </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> the dollar </ARG1> was <quote.01>quoted</quote.01> <ARG2-at> at 1.8500 marks , up from 1.8415 marks late Tuesday </ARG2-at> , and at 143.80 yen , up from 142.85 yen late Tuesday .
<ARG1> Sterling </ARG1> was <quote.01>quoted</quote.01> <ARG2-at> at $ 1.5755 , down from $ 1.5805 late Tuesday </ARG2-at> .
<ARGM-LOC> In Tokyo </ARGM-LOC> <ARGM-TMP> Thursday </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> the U.S. currency </ARG1> <open.02>opened</open.02> <ARGM-PNC> for trading </ARGM-PNC> <ARGM-EXT> at 143.93 yen , up from Wednesday 's Tokyo close of 143.08 yen </ARGM-EXT> .
<ARG0> Douglas Madison , a corporate trader with Bank of America in Los Angeles , </ARG0> <trace.02>traced</trace.02> <ARG1> the dollar 's recent solid performance against the yen </ARG1> <ARG2-to> to purchases of securities by Japanese insurance companies and trust banks and the sense that another wave of investment is waiting in the wings </ARG2-to> .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <contend.01>contends</contend.01> <ARG1> that the perception in Japan of a vitriolic U.S. response to Sony Corp. 's announcement of its purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. has been temporarily mollified </ARG1> .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <cite.01>cites</cite.01> <ARG1> the recent deal between the Mitsubishi Estate Co. and the Rockefeller Group , as well as the possible white knight role of an undisclosed Japanese company in the Georgia-Pacific Corp. takeover bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. </ARG1> <ARG2-as> as evidence </ARG2-as> .
The forthcoming maturity in November of <ARG1> a 10-year Japanese government yen-denominated bond issue </ARG1> <value.01>valued</value.01> <ARG2-at> at about $ 16 billion </ARG2-at> has prompted speculation in the market that investors redeeming the bonds will diversify into dollar-denominated instruments , according to Mr. Madison .
It <remain.01>remains</remain.01> <ARG3> unclear </ARG3> <ARG1> whether the bond issue will be rolled over </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> Meanwhile </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> traders in Tokyo </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> <ARG1> that the prospect of lower U.S. interest rates has spurred dollar buying by Japanese institutions </ARG1> .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <point.02>point</point.02> out <ARG1> that these institutions want to lock in returns on high-yield U.S. Treasury debt </ARG1> and suggest demand for the U.S. unit will continue unabated until rates in the U.S. recede .
<ARG0> The market </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> again </ARGM-TMP> <show.01>showed</show.01> <ARG1> little interest in further evidence of a slowing U.S. economy </ARG1> , and traders note that the market in recent weeks has taken its cues more from Wall Street than U.S. economic indicators .
<ARG0> Dealers </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the dollar merely drifted lower following the release Wednesday of the U.S. purchasing managers ' report .
The managers ' index , which <measure.01>measures</measure.01> <ARG1> the health of the manufacturing sector </ARG1> , stood at 47.6 % in October , above September 's 46 % , and also above average forecasts for the index of 45.3 % .
<ARG0> Some dealers </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the dollar was pressured slightly because a number of market participants had boosted their expectations in the past day and were looking for an index above 50 , which indicates an expanding manufacturing economy .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> most </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the index had no more than a minimal effect on trade .

`` <ARG0> The Cosby Show </ARG0> '' <ARGM-MOD> may </ARGM-MOD> have <ARGM-MNR> single-handedly </ARGM-MNR> <turn.01>turned</turn.01> <ARGM-DIR> around </ARGM-DIR> <ARG1> ratings at NBC </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> since its debut in 1984 </ARGM-TMP> , and the Huxtable family still keeps millions of viewers laughing Thursday night on the network .
But some of <ARG0> the TV stations that </ARG0> <buy.01>bought</buy.01> <ARG1> `` Cosby '' reruns </ARG1> <ARG3-for> for record prices </ARG3-for> <ARGM-TMP> two years ago </ARGM-TMP> are n't laughing much these days .
<ARG0> The reruns </ARG0> have <help.01>helped</help.01> <ARG1> ratings at many of the 187 network affiliates and independent TV stations that air the shows </ARG1> .
But the ratings are considerably below expectations , and <ARG0> some stations </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> they may not buy new episodes when their current contracts expire .
<ARGM-TMP> Meanwhile </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> stations </ARG1> are <fume.01>fuming</fume.01> because , many of them say , the show 's distributor , Viacom Inc. , is giving an ultimatum : Either sign new long-term commitments to buy future episodes or risk losing `` Cosby '' to a competitor .
<ARGM-TMP> At the same time </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Viacom </ARG0> is <try.01>trying</try.01> <ARG1> to persuade stations to make commitments to `` A Different World , '' a spin-off of `` Cosby '' whose reruns will become available in 1991 </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Viacom </ARG0> <deny.01>denies</deny.01> it 's using pressure tactics .
`` <ARG0> We </ARG0> 're willing to <negotiate.01>negotiate</negotiate.01> , '' says Dennis Gillespie , executive vice president of marketing .
`` <ARG0> We </ARG0> 're <offer.01>offering</offer.01> <ARG1> this plan </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> now </ARGM-TMP> because we feel it 's the right time . ''
But , <say.01>says</say.01> <ARG0> the general manager of a network affiliate in the Midwest </ARG0> , `` I think if I tell them I need more time , they 'll take ` Cosby ' across the street , ''
<ARG1> Viacom 's move </ARG1> <come.01>comes</come.01> <ARGM-TMP> as the syndication market is being flooded with situation comedies that are still running on the networks </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> One station manager </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> he believes Viacom 's move is a `` pre-emptive strike '' because the company is worried that `` Cosby '' ratings will continue to drop in syndication over the next few years .
<ARG0> Mr. Gillespie at Viacom </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> the ratings are rising .
<ARGM-DIS> And </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> executives at stations in such major markets as Washington ; Providence , R.I. ; Cleveland ; Raleigh , N.C. ; Minneapolis , and Louisville , Ky. , </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> they may very well not renew `` Cosby . ''
<ARG0> Dick Lobo , the general manager of WTVJ , the NBC-owned station in Miami </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> , for example , </ARGM-DIS> <say.01>says</say.01> the show has `` been a major disappointment to us . ''
`` At the prices <ARG2> we </ARG2> were <charge.01>charged</charge.01> , there should have been some return for the dollar .
<ARG0> Neil Kuvin , the general manager of WHAS , the CBS affiliate in Louisville , </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> `` Cosby '' gets the station 's highest ratings and he 's `` pleased . ''
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> he </ARG0> <add.01>adds</add.01> , `` <ARG1> I feel pressured , disappointed , uncomfortable and , frankly , quite angry with Viacom </ARG1> .

<ARGM-DIS> So </ARGM-DIS> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <ARG0> a magazine </ARG0> <survive.01>survive</survive.01> <ARGM-MNR> by downright thumbing its nose at major advertisers </ARGM-MNR> ?
<ARG1> Garbage magazine </ARG1> , <bill.02>billed</bill.02> as `` <ARG2> The Practical Journal for the Environment </ARG2> , '' is about to find out .
<found.01>Founded</found.01> <ARG0-by> by Brooklyn , N.Y. , publishing entrepreneur Patricia Poore </ARG0-by> , <ARG1> Garbage </ARG1> made its debut this fall with the promise to give consumers the straight scoop on the U.S. waste crisis .
<ARG0> The magazine </ARG0> <combine.01>combines</combine.01> <ARG1> how-to pieces on topics like backyard composting , explanatory essays on such things as what happens after you flush your toilet , and hard-hitting pieces on alleged environmental offenders </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Garbage editors </ARG0> have <dump.01>dumped</dump.01> <ARG1> considerable energy </ARG1> <ARGM-DIR> into a whirling rampage through supermarket aisles </ARGM-DIR> <ARGM-ADV> in a bid to identify corporate America 's good guys and bad boys </ARGM-ADV> .
In <ARG1> one feature </ARG1> , <call.01>called</call.01> <ARG2> `` In the Dumpster </ARG2> , '' editors point out a product they deem to be a particularly bad offender .
<ARGM-MNR> With only two issues under its belt </ARGM-MNR> , <ARG0> Garbage </ARG0> has <alienate.01>alienated</alienate.01> <ARG1> some would-be advertisers </ARG1> and raised the ire of others .
Campbell Soup , for one , is furious <ARG1> its Souper Combo microwave product </ARG1> was <chastise.01>chastised</chastise.01> <ARGM-LOC> in the premiere `` In the Dumpster '' column </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG0> The magazine 's editors </ARG0> <run.09>ran</run.09> a giant diagram of the product with arrows pointing to the packaging 's polystyrene foam , polyproplene and polyester film -- all plastic items they say are non-biodegradable .
`` It 's precisely <ARG0> the kind of product that </ARG0> 's <create.01>created</create.01> <ARG1> the municipal landfill monster </ARG1> , '' the editors wrote .
`` <ARG0> I </ARG0> <think.01>think</think.01> <ARG1> that this magazine is not only called Garbage , but it is practicing journalistic garbage </ARG1> , '' fumes a spokesman for Campbell Soup .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> Campbell was n't even contacted by the magazine for the opportunity to comment .
Modifications had been <make.01>made</make.01> to the Souper Combo product at the time the issue was printed , he says , making it less an offender than was portrayed .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <admit.01>admits</admit.01> <ARGM-DIS> , though , </ARGM-DIS> it is n't one of Campbell Soup 's better products in terms of recyclability .
<ARG0> Campbell Soup </ARG0> , <ARGM-ADV> not surprisingly </ARGM-ADV> , does <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <have.03>have</have.03> <ARG1> any plans to advertise in the magazine </ARG1> , <ARGM-ADV> according to its spokesman </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> Some media experts </ARG0> <question.01>question</question.01> <ARG1> whether a young magazine can risk turning off Madison Avenue 's big spenders </ARG1> .
`` <ARG0> You </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> really </ARGM-ADV> <need.01>need</need.01> <ARG1> the Campbell Soups of the world to be interested in your magazine </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> if you 're going to make a run of it </ARGM-ADV> , '' says Mike White , senior vice president and media director at DDB Needham , Chicago .
`` <ARG0> The economics of magazine publishing </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> pretty much </ARGM-ADV> <require.01>require</require.01> <ARG1> that you have a pretty solid base '' of big-time ad spenders </ARG1> , he adds .
<ARG0> The first two issues </ARG0> <feature.01>featured</feature.01> <ARG1> ads from only a handful of big advertisers , including General Electric and Adolph Coors </ARG1> , but the majority were from companies like Waste Management Inc. and Bumkins International , firms that do n't spend much money advertising and ca n't be relied on to support a magazine over the long haul .
<ARG0> A Waste Management spokeswoman </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> its ad in the premiere issue was a one-time purchase , and it does n't have any plans to advertise in future issues .
`` <ARG0> We </ARG0> do <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <spend.01>spend</spend.01> <ARG3> much </ARG3> <ARG1-on> on print advertising </ARG1-on> , '' she says .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> Ms. Poore , the magazine 's editor and publisher , </ARG0> <contend.01>contends</contend.01> Garbage can survive , at least initially , on subscription revenues .
<ARG1> Individual copies of the magazine </ARG1> <sell.01>sell</sell.01> <ARG3-for> for $ 2.95 </ARG3-for> and yearly subscriptions cost $ 21 .

<ARG0> I </ARG0> 'm <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> <say.01>saying</say.01> advertising revenue is n't important , '' she says , `` but I could n't sleep at night '' if the magazine bowed to a company because they once took out an ad .
<ARG0> Interpublic Group </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> its television programming operations -- which it expanded earlier this year -- agreed to supply more than 4,000 hours of original programming across Europe in 1990 .
<ARG0> It </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the programs , largely game shows , will be provided by its E.C. Television unit along with Fremantle International , a producer and distributor of game shows of which it recently bought 49 % .

<ARG0> Sea Containers Ltd. </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it might increase the price of its $ 70-a-share buy-back plan if pressed by Temple Holdings Ltd. , which made an earlier tender offer for Sea Containers .
<ARG0> Sea Containers , a Hamilton , Bermuda-based shipping concern , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARGM-TMP> Tuesday </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> that it would sell $ 1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50 % of its common shares for $ 70 apiece </ARG1> .
<ARG1> The move </ARG1> is <design.01>designed</design.01> <ARGM-PNC> to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two European shipping concerns , Stena Holding AG and Tiphook PLC </ARGM-PNC> .
In May , the two companies , through their <ARGM-MNR> jointly </ARGM-MNR> <own.01>owned</own.01> <ARG1> holding company </ARG1> , Temple , offered $ 50 a share , or $ 777 million , for Sea Containers .
<ARGM-TMP> In August </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Temple </ARG0> <sweeten.02>sweetened</sweeten.02> <ARG1> the offer </ARG1> <ARG2-to> to $ 63 a share , or $ 963 million </ARG2-to> .
<ARGM-TMP> Yesterday </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Sea Containers ' chief executive officer , James Sherwood , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARGM-LOC> in an interview </ARGM-LOC> <ARG1> that , under the asset-sale plan , Sea Containers would end up with a cash surplus of approximately $ 620 million </ARG1> .
<ARG1> About $ 490 million of that </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> be <allocate.01>allocated</allocate.01> <ARG2-to> to the buy-back </ARG2-to> , <ARGM-ADV> leaving about $ 130 million </ARGM-ADV> , he said .
That $ 130 million , <ARG0> Mr. Sherwood </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> , `` gives us some flexibility in case Temple raises its bid .
<ARG0> We </ARG0> are able to <increase.01>increase</increase.01> <ARG1> our price </ARG1> <ARG4-above> above the $ 70 level </ARG4-above> if necessary .
'' <ARG0> He </ARG0> <decline.02>declined</decline.02> <ARG1> to say , however , how much Sea Containers might raise its price </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Mr. Sherwood </ARG0> <speculate.01>speculated</speculate.01> <ARG1> that the leeway that Sea Containers has means that Temple would have to `` substantially increase their bid if they 're going to top us </ARG1> . ''
<ARG0> Temple </ARG0> , <ARGM-DIS> however </ARGM-DIS> , <ARGM-MNR> harshly </ARGM-MNR> <criticize.01>criticized</criticize.01> <ARG1> Sea Containers ' plan </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> yesterday </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-ADV> characterizing it as a `` highly conditional device designed to entrench management , confuse shareholders and prevent them from accepting our superior cash offer </ARGM-ADV> . ''
<ARG0> A spokesman for Temple </ARG0> <estimate.01>estimated</estimate.01> <ARG1> that Sea Containers ' plan -- if all the asset sales materialize -- would result in shareholders receiving only $ 36 to $ 45 a share in cash </ARG1> .
The lower figures , <ARG0> the spokesman </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> , would stem from preferred shares being converted to common stock and the possibility that Sea Containers ' subsidiaries might be required to place their shares in the open market .
<ARG0> Temple </ARG0> <add.01>added</add.01> <ARG1> that Sea Containers is still mired in legal problems in Bermuda , where the Supreme Court has temporarily barred Sea Containers from buying back its own stock in a case brought by Stena and Tiphook </ARG1> .
-LCB- <ARG0> The court </ARG0> has <indicate.01>indicated</indicate.01> it will rule on the case by the end of the month . -RCB-
<ARG0> Temple </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <say.01>said</say.01> Sea Containers ' plan raises `` numerous legal , regulatory , financial and fairness issues , '' but did n't elaborate .
<ARG0> Mr. Sherwood </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> reaction to Sea Containers ' proposal has been `` very positive . ''
<ARGM-LOC> In New York Stock Exchange composite trading </ARGM-LOC> <ARGM-TMP> yesterday </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> Sea Containers </ARG1> <close.02>closed</close.02> <ARGM-EXT> at $ 62.625 </ARGM-EXT> , <ARGM-MNR> up 62.5 cents </ARGM-MNR> .
<ARG0> The Transportation Department </ARG0> , <respond.01>responding</respond.01> <ARG1-to> to pressure from safety advocates </ARG1-to> , took further steps to impose on light trucks and vans the safety requirements used for automobiles .
<ARG0> The department </ARG0> <propose.01>proposed</propose.01> <ARG1> requiring stronger roofs for light trucks and minivans , beginning with 1992 models </ARG1> .
<ARG0> It </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <issue.01>issued</issue.01> <ARG1> a final rule requiring auto makers to equip light trucks and minivans with lap-shoulder belts for rear seats beginning in the 1992 model year </ARG1> .
<ARG1> Such belts </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> already </ARGM-TMP> are <require.01>required</require.01> <ARGM-PNC> for the vehicles ' front seats </ARGM-PNC> .
`` Today 's action , '' <ARG0> Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> , `` represents another milestone in the ongoing program to promote vehicle occupant safety in light trucks and minivans through its extension of passenger car standards . ''
<ARGM-TMP> In September </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> the department </ARG0> had <say.01>said</say.01> it will require trucks and minivans to be equipped with the same front-seat headrests that have long been required on passenger cars .
<ARG0> The Big Three auto makers </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the rule changes were n't surprising because Bush administration officials have long said they planned to impose car safety standards on light trucks and vans .
<ARG2> Safety advocates </ARG2> , <include.01>including</include.01> <ARG1> some members of Congress </ARG1> , have been urging the department for years to extend car-safety requirements to light trucks and vans , which now account for almost one-third of all vehicle sales in the U.S. .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> <ARG1> that many vehicles classed as commercial light trucks actually carry more people than cargo and therefore should have the same safety features as cars </ARG1> .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> did <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <have.03>have</have.03> <ARG1> much luck </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> during the Reagan administration </ARGM-TMP> .
`` But <ARGM-TMP> now </ARGM-TMP> , there <seem.01>seems</seem.01> <ARG1> to be a fairly systematic effort to address the problem </ARG1> , '' said Chuck Hurley , vice president of communications for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety .
<ARG0> Sen. John Danforth -LRB- R. , Mo . -RRB- </ARG0> <praise.01>praised</praise.01> <ARG1> the department 's actions </ARG1> , <ARGM-ADV> noting that rollover crashes account for almost half of all light-truck deaths </ARGM-ADV> .
`` <ARG0> We </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <prevent.01>prevent</prevent.01> <ARG1> many of these fatalities </ARG1> <ARG3-with> with minimum roof-crush standards </ARG3-with> , '' he said .
<ARG0> Sen. Danforth and others </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <want.01>want</want.01> <ARG1> the department to require additional safety equipment in light trucks and minivans , including air bags or automatic seat belts in front seats and improved side-crash protection </ARG1> .
<ARG1> The department 's roof-crush proposal </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <apply.02>apply</apply.02> <ARG2-to> to vehicles weighing 10,000 pounds or less </ARG2-to> .
<ARG2> The roofs </ARG2> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> be <require.01>required</require.01> <ARG1> to withstand a force of 1.5 times the unloaded weight of the vehicle </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> During the test </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> the roof </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> be <depress.02>depressed</depress.02> <ARG2-EXT> more than five inches </ARG2-EXT> .
<ARGM-LOC> In Detroit </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> a Chrysler Corp. official </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the company currently has no rear-seat lap and shoulder belts in its light trucks , but plans to begin phasing them in by the end of the 1990 model year .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> Chrysler fully expects to have them installed across its light-truck line by the Sept. 1 , 1991 , deadline .
<ARG0> Chrysler </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> its trucks and vans already meet the roof-crush resistance standard for cars .
<ARG0> John Leinonen , executive engineer of Ford Motor Co. 's auto-safety office , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> Ford trucks have met car standards for roof-crush resistance since 1982 .
Ford <begin.01>began</begin.01> installing the rear-seat belts in trucks <ARG2-with> with its F-series Crew Cab pickups </ARG2-with> <ARGM-TMP> in the 1989 model year </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG1> The new Explorer sport-utility vehicle </ARG1> , <set.XX>set</set.XX> <ARG2-for> for introduction next spring </ARG2-for> , will also have the rear-seat belts .
<ARG0> Mr. Leinonen </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> he expects Ford to meet the deadline easily .
<ARG0> Consolidated Rail Corp. </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it would spend more than $ 30 million on 1,000 enclosed railcars for transporting autos .
<ARG1> The multilevel railcars </ARG1> , <schedule.01>scheduled</schedule.01> <ARG2-for> for delivery in 1990 </ARG2-for> , will be made by Thrall Manufacturing Co. , a Chicago Heights , Ill. , division of closely held Duchossois Industries Inc. , Elmhurst , Ill .

<ARG0> Bank of New England Corp. </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it has held talks with potential merger partners outside New England , <ARGM-ADV> although it added that nothing is imminent and it has n't received any formal offers </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG1> The discussions </ARG1> were <disclose.01>disclosed</disclose.01> <ARGM-ADV> as the bank holding company said that it has dropped its longstanding opposition to full interstate banking bills in Connecticut and in Massachusetts </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARGM-TMP> Later yesterday </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> a Massachusetts senate committee </ARG0> <approve.01>approved</approve.01> a bill to allow national interstate banking by banks in the state beginning in 1991 .
<ARGM-TMP> Currently </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> both Massachusetts and Connecticut , where most of Bank of New England 's operations are , </ARG0> <allow.01>allow</allow.01> <ARG1> interstate banking </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> only within New England </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG0> Richard Driscoll , vice chairman of Bank of New England , </ARG0> <tell.01>told</tell.01> <ARG2> the Dow Jones Professional Investor Report </ARG2> , `` <ARG1> Certainly , there are those outside the region who think of us prospectively as a good partner </ARG1> .

Mr. Driscoll did n't elaborate about who the potential partners were or <ARGM-TMP> when </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> the talks </ARG1> were <hold.04>held</hold.04> .
<ARG0> A bank spokeswoman </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <decline.02>declined</decline.02> <ARG1> to comment on any merger-related matters </ARG1> , but said the company decided to drop its opposition to the interstate banking legislation because `` prevailing sentiment is in favor of passage .

<ARGM-TMP> When </ARGM-TMP> <ARG0> Warren Winiarski , proprietor of Stag 's Leap Wine Cellars in Napa Valley , </ARG0> <announce.01>announced</announce.01> <ARG1> a $ 75 price tag for his 1985 Cask 23 Cabernet </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> this fall </ARGM-TMP> , few wine shops and restaurants around the country balked .
`` This is the peak of my wine-making experience , '' <ARG0> Mr. Winiarski </ARG0> <declare.02>declared</declare.02> <ARGM-TMP> when he introduced the wine at a dinner in New York </ARGM-TMP> , `` and I wanted to single it out as such . ''
It is in my estimation the best wine <ARG0> Stag 's Leap </ARG0> has <produce.01>produced</produce.01> , and with fewer than 700 cases available , it is sure to sell quickly .
<ARG0> Diamond Creek 1985 Lake Vineyard Cabernet </ARG0> <weigh.03>weighed</weigh.03> in <ARGM-TMP> this fall </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1-with> with a sticker price of $ 100 a bottle </ARG1-with> .
One of the <ARGM-MNR> fastest </ARGM-MNR> <grow.01>growing</grow.01> <ARG1> segments </ARG1> of the wine market is the category of superpremiums -- wines limited in production , of exceptional quality -LRB- or so perceived , at any rate -RRB- , and with exceedingly high prices .
<ARGM-TMP> For years </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG2> this group </ARG2> <include.01>included</include.01> <ARG1> a stable of classics -- Bordeaux first growths -LRB- Lafite-Rothschild , Latour , Haut-Brion , Petrus -RRB- , Grand Cru Burgundies -LRB- Romanee-Conti and La Tache -RRB- deluxe Champagnes -LRB- Dom Perignon or Roederer Cristal -RRB- , rarefied sweet wines -LRB- Chateau Yquem or Trockenbeerenauslesen Rieslings from Germany , and Biondi-Santi Brunello Riserva from Tuscany -RRB- </ARG1> .
<ARG1> These first magnitude wines </ARG1> <range.01>ranged</range.01> <ARG5-in> in price </ARG5-in> <ARG3-from> from $ 40 </ARG3-from> <ARG4-to> to $ 125 a bottle </ARG4-to> .
<ARGM-TMP> In the last year or so </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-DIS> however </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> this exclusive club </ARG0> has <take.06>taken</take.06> in <ARG1> a host of flashy new members </ARG1> .
<ARG1> The classics </ARG1> have <zoom.01>zoomed</zoom.01> <ARGM-MNR> in price </ARGM-MNR> <ARGM-PNC> to meet the competition </ARGM-PNC> , and it almost seems that there 's a race on to come up with the priciest single bottle , among current releases from every major wine region on the globe .
<ARG0> France </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <boast.01>boast</boast.01> <ARG1> the lion 's share of high-priced bottles </ARG1> .
Bordeaux 's first growths from 1985 and 1986 are $ 60 to $ 80 each -LRB- except for the smallest in terms of production , Chateau Petrus , which <cost.01>costs</cost.01> <ARG2> around $ 250 </ARG2> ! -RRB- .
These prices <seem.01>seem</seem.01> rather modest , <ARGM-DIS> however </ARGM-DIS> , <ARGM-ADV> in light of other French wines from current vintages </ARGM-ADV> .
Chateau Yquem , the <lead.01>leading</lead.01> <ARG0> Sauternes </ARG0> , now goes for well over $ 100 a bottle for a lighter vintage like 1984 ; the spectacularly rich 1983 runs $ 179 .
<ARGM-LOC> In Champagne </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG1> some of the prestige cuvees </ARG1> are <inch.01>inching</inch.01> <ARG4-toward> toward $ 100 a bottle </ARG4-toward> .
The first Champagne to <crack.02>crack</crack.02> <ARG1> that price barrier </ARG1> was the 1979 Salon de Mesnil Blanc de Blancs .
<ARG1> Roederer Cristal </ARG1> <ARG3-at> at $ 90 a bottle </ARG3-at> <sell.01>sells</sell.01> out <ARGM-LOC> around the country </ARGM-LOC> and Taittinger 's Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs is encroaching upon that level .
<ARG1> The great reds of the Rhone Valley </ARG1> have <soar.01>soared</soar.01> <ARGM-MNR> in price </ARGM-MNR> <ARGM-DIS> as well </ARGM-DIS> .
<ARG0> None of France 's wine regions </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <steal.01>steal</steal.01> <ARG1> a march on Burgundy </ARG1> , <ARGM-ADV> however </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> The six wines of the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti , 72 of the most precious acres of vineyard anywhere in the world , </ARG0> have <command.01>commanded</command.01> <ARG1> three-digit price tags </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> for several years now </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARGM-LOC> With the 1985 vintage </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG1> they </ARG1> <soar.01>soared</soar.01> <ARG2-EXT> higher </ARG2-EXT> : La Tache , $ 195 ; Richebourg , $ 180 ; Romanee-Conti , $ 225 .
<ARG0> Another small Burgundy estate , Coche-Dury , </ARG0> has <ARGM-TMP> just </ARGM-TMP> <offer.01>offered</offer.01> <ARG1> its 1987 Corton-Charlemagne </ARG1> <ARG2-for> for $ 155 </ARG2-for> .
<ARG1> Spain 's Vega Secilia Unico 1979 </ARG1> -LRB- <release.01>released</release.01> <ARGM-TMP> only in its 10th year </ARGM-TMP> -RRB- is $ 70 , as is Australia 's Grange Hermitage 1982 .
`` There are <ARG0> certain cult wines that </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <command.01>command</command.01> <ARG1> these higher prices </ARG1> , '' says Larry Shapiro of Marty 's , one of the largest wine shops in Dallas .
`` What 's different is that <ARG1> it </ARG1> is <happen.01>happening</happen.01> <ARG2-with> with young wines just coming out </ARG2-with> .
<ARG0> We </ARG0> 're <see.01>seeing</see.01> <ARG1> it </ARG1> <ARGM-CAU> partly because older vintages are growing more scarce </ARGM-CAU> . ''
<ARG0> Wine auctions </ARG0> have <ARGM-ADV> almost </ARGM-ADV> <exhaust.01>exhausted</exhaust.01> <ARG1> the limited supply of those wines </ARG1> , Mr. Shapiro continued : `` We 've seen a dramatic decrease in demand for wines from the '40s and '50s , which go for $ 300 to $ 400 a bottle .
<ARG0> Some of the newer wines , even at $ 90 to $ 100 a bottle or so , </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> almost </ARGM-ADV> <offer.01>offer</offer.01> <ARG1> a bargain </ARG1> . ''
<take.01><ARG0></take.01> <ARG1> Lake Vineyard Cabernet from Diamond Creek </ARG1> . </ARG0>
<ARG1> It </ARG1> 's <make.01>made</make.01> <ARGM-TMP> only in years when the grapes ripen perfectly -LRB- the last was 1979 -RRB- </ARGM-TMP> and comes from a single acre of grapes that yielded a mere 75 cases in 1987 .
<ARG0> Owner Al Brownstein </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> originally </ARGM-TMP> <plan.01>planned</plan.01> <ARG1> to sell it for $ 60 a bottle </ARG1> , but when a retailer in Southern California asked , `` Is that wholesale or retail ? '' he re-thought the matter .
<offer.01>Offering</offer.01> <ARG1> the wine </ARG1> <ARG2-at> at roughly $ 65 a bottle wholesale -LRB- $ 100 retail -RRB- </ARG2-at> , <ARG0> he </ARG0> sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers : 1 -RRB- no , the wine is too high -LRB- 2 responses -RRB- ; 2 -RRB- yes , it 's high but I 'll take it -LRB- 2 responses -RRB- ; 3 -RRB- I 'll take all I can get -LRB- 58 responses -RRB- .
<ARG1> The wine </ARG1> was <ship.01>shipped</ship.01> <ARGM-MNR> in six-bottle cases instead of the usual 12 </ARGM-MNR> , but even at that it was spread thin , going to 62 retailers in 28 states .
`` <ARG0> We </ARG0> <think.01>thought</think.01> it was awfully expensive , '' said Sterling Pratt , wine director at Schaefer 's in Skokie , Ill. , one of the top stores in suburban Chicago , `` but there are people out there with very different opinions of value .
<ARG0> We </ARG0> <get.01>got</get.01> <ARG1> our two six-packs </ARG1> -- and they 're gone . ''
<ARG0> Mr. Pratt </ARG0> <remark.01>remarked</remark.01> that he thinks steeper prices have come about because producers do n't like to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on .
Even if there is consumer resistance at first , <ARG0> a wine that </ARG0> <win.01>wins</win.01> <ARG1> high ratings </ARG1> <ARG3-from> from the critics </ARG3-from> will eventually move .
`` There may be sticker-shock reaction initially , '' <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG0> Mr. Pratt </ARG0> , `` but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell , they eventually get excited and decide it 's worth the astronomical price to add it to their collection . ''
`` <ARG1> It 's just sort of a one-upsmanship thing with some people </ARG1> , '' <add.01>added</add.01> <ARG0> Larry Shapiro </ARG0> .
`` <ARG0> They </ARG0> <like.01>like</like.01> <ARG1> to talk about having the new Red Rock Terrace -LCB- one of Diamond Creek 's Cabernets -RCB- or the Dunn 1985 Cabernet , or the Petrus </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Producers </ARG0> have <see.01>seen</see.01> <ARG1> this market opening up </ARG1> and they 're now creating wines that appeal to these people . ''
<ARG0> That </ARG0> <explain.01>explains</explain.01> <ARG1> why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly </ARG1> .
But <ARG0> consumers who </ARG0> <buy.01>buy</buy.01> <ARGM-ADV> at this level </ARGM-ADV> are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago .
`` <ARG0> They </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> wo </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <buy.01>buy</buy.01> <ARGM-ADV> if the quality is not there </ARGM-ADV> , '' said Cedric Martin of Martin Wine Cellar in New Orleans .
`` Or if <ARG0> they </ARG0> <feel.02>feel</feel.02> the wine is overpriced and they can get something equally good for less . ''
<ARG0> Mr. Martin </ARG0> has <increase.01>increased</increase.01> <ARG1> prices on some wines -LRB- like Grgich Hills Chardonnay , now $ 32 -RRB- </ARG1> <ARGM-PNC> just to slow down movement </ARGM-PNC> , but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red Burgundies and Cabernets and Chardonnays in the $ 30 to $ 40 range .
<ARG0> Image </ARG0> <have.03>has</have.03> <ARGM-DIS> , of course , </ARGM-DIS> a great deal to do with what sells and what does n't , and it ca n't be forced .
<ARG0> Wine merchants </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> ca </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <keep.04>keep</keep.04> <ARG1> Roederer Cristal </ARG1> <ARG2-in> in stock </ARG2-in> , but they have to push Salon le Mesnil , even lowering the price from $ 115 to $ 90 .
It 's hardly a question of quality -- the 1982 Salon is a beautiful wine , but , as <ARG0> Mr. Pratt </ARG0> <note.XX>noted</note.XX> , people have their own ideas about value .
<ARG0> It 's interesting to <find.01>find</find.01> <ARG1> that a lot of the expensive wines are n't always walking out the door </ARG1> . </ARG0>
<ARGM-LOC> In every major market in the U.S. </ARGM-LOC> , <ARGM-DIS> for instance </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> you </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <buy.01>buy</buy.01> <ARG1> '86 La Tache or Richebourg , virtually all of the first growth Bordeaux -LRB- except Petrus -RRB- , as well as Opus One and Dominus from California and , at the moment , the Stag 's Leap 1985 Cask 23 </ARG1> .
With <ARG1> the biggest wine-buying period of the year </ARG1> <loom.01>looming</loom.01> <ARGM-TMP> as the holidays approach </ARGM-TMP> , it will be interesting to see how the superpremiums fare .
Signs of a <slow.02>slowing</slow.02> <ARG1> economy </ARG1> are increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates , but it is n't clear whether the central bank will do so .
<ARG0> A survey by the Fed 's 12 district banks </ARG0> <show.01>shows</show.01> economic growth has been sluggish in recent weeks , while upward pressures on prices have moderated .
`` <ARG1> The economy </ARG1> is <ARGM-ADV> clearly </ARGM-ADV> <slow.01>slowing</slow.01> , '' says Robert Black , president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank .
`` If <ARG0> you </ARG0> <look.01>look</look.01> <ARG1-at> at the third quarter </ARG1-at> <ARG2-as> as posting roughly 2.5 % growth </ARG2-as> , I do see some slowing in the fourth quarter , '' agrees Kansas City Fed President Roger Guffey .
<ARGM-DIS> Nevertheless </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> both Mr. Guffey and Mr. Black </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> the slowdown so far is no cause for concern .
`` <ARG1> We </ARG1> 're <come.04>coming</come.04> <ARG2> closer to achieving the stated objective of slowing the economy to a point where hopefully some downward trend in prices will occur </ARG2> , '' said Mr. Guffey .
<ARG0> Bush administration officials </ARG0> are <look.01>looking</look.01> <ARG1-to> to the Fed </ARG1-to> <ARG2> to bring down rates </ARG2> , and financial markets seem to be expecting easier credit as well .
`` <ARG0> I </ARG0> <think.01>think</think.01> the market had been expecting the Fed to ease sooner and a little more than it has to date , '' said Robert Johnson , vice president of global markets for Bankers Trust Co .
<ARG0> The Fed </ARG0> <cut.02>cut</cut.02> <ARG1> the key federal funds interest rate </ARG1> <ARG2-by> by about 0.25 percentage point </ARG2-by> <ARG4-to> to 8.75 % </ARG4-to> <ARGM-TMP> after the Oct. 13 stock market plunge </ARGM-TMP> , but has shown no sign of movement since .
<ARG0> The report from the Fed </ARG0> <find.01>found</find.01> <ARG1> that manufacturing , in particular , has been weak in recent weeks </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The Philadelphia Fed </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> , for instance , </ARGM-DIS> <report.01>reported</report.01> <ARG1> that manufacturing activity `` continues to decline '' for the fourth month in a row </ARG1> .
And in the Chicago district , <ARG0> the report </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> , `` a manufacturer of capital goods noted slower orders for some types , including defense equipment , petroleum equipment , food packaging machinery and material handling equipment . ''
Retail sales <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> were <report.01>reported</report.01> slow <ARGM-LOC> in most districts </ARGM-LOC> , <ARGM-ADV> particularly `` for discretionary , big-ticket items such as furniture , home appliances and consumer electronics </ARGM-ADV> . ''
<ARGM-DIS> And </ARGM-DIS> <ARG1> construction </ARG1> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> was <describe.01>described</describe.01> <ARG2-as> as slow </ARG2-as> <ARGM-LOC> in most areas </ARGM-LOC> .
Despite the economic slowdown , there are few clear signs that <ARG1> growth </ARG1> is <come.04>coming</come.04> <ARG2-to> to a halt </ARG2-to> .
<ARGM-ADV> As a result </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG1> Fed officials </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> may </ARGM-MOD> be <divide.02>divided</divide.02> <ARGM-PNC> over whether to ease credit </ARGM-PNC> .
<ARG0> Several Fed governors in Washington </ARG0> have been <push.02>pushing</push.02> <ARG2-for> for easier credit </ARG2-for> ; but many of the regional Fed presidents have been resisting such a move .
<ARG0> Mr. Black </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> he is `` pleased '' with the economy 's recent performance , and does n't see `` a lot of excesses out there that would tilt us into recession . ''
`` There is always a chance of recession , '' <add.01>added</add.01> <ARG0> Mr. Guffey </ARG0> , `` but if you ask me to put a percentage on it , I would think it 's well below a 50 % chance .
<ARG0> Integra-A Hotel & Restaurant Co. </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> its planned rights offering to raise about $ 9 million was declared effective and the company will begin mailing materials to shareholders at the end of this week .
<ARGM-LOC> Under the offer </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> shareholders </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <receive.01>receive</receive.01> <ARG1> one right </ARG1> <ARG3-for> for each 105 common shares owned </ARG3-for> .
<ARG0> Each right </ARG0> <entitle.01>entitles</entitle.01> <ARG1> the shareholder to buy $ 100 face amount of 13.5 % bonds due 1993 and warrants to buy 23.5 common shares at 30 cents a share </ARG1> .
The rights , which <expire.01>expire</expire.01> <ARGM-TMP> Nov. 21 </ARGM-TMP> , can be exercised for $ 100 each .
Integra , which <own.01>owns</own.01> and operates <ARG1> hotels </ARG1> , said that Hallwood Group Inc. has agreed to exercise any rights that are n't exercised by other shareholders .
<ARG0> Hallwood , a Cleveland merchant bank , </ARG0> <own.01>owns</own.01> <ARG1> about 11 % of Integra </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Copperweld Corp. , a specialty steelmaker , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> 445 workers at a plant in Shelby , Ohio , began a strike after the United Steelworkers Local 3057 rejected a new contract on Tuesday .
<ARG1> The previous contract between Copperweld 's Ohio Steel Tube division and the union </ARG1> <expire.01>expired</expire.01> <ARGM-TMP> at midnight </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-TMP> Tuesday </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> The union vote to <reject.01>reject</reject.01> <ARG1> the proposed pact </ARG1> was 230-215 . </ARG0>
<ARG0> Copperweld </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it does n't expect a protracted strike .
<ARG0> It </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it has taken measures to continue shipments during the work stoppage .
<ARG0> The Treasury </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it plans to sell $ 30 billion in notes and bonds next week , but said the auctions will be postponed unless Congress acts quickly to lift the federal debt ceiling .
<ARG0> Michael Basham , deputy assistant secretary for federal finance , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the Treasury may wait until late Monday or even early Tuesday to announce whether the autions are to be rescheduled .
Unless <ARG0> it </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <raise.01>raise</raise.01> <ARG1> money </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> in financial markets </ARGM-LOC> , Mr. Basham said , the federal government wo n't have the cash to pay off $ 13.8 billion in Treasury bills that mature on Thursday .
<ARGM-ADV> Without congressional action </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> the Treasury </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> ca </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <sell.01>sell</sell.01> <ARG1> any new securities -- even savings bonds </ARG1> .
But despite partisan bickering over the debt ceiling , which has <become.01>become</become.01> <ARG2> entangled in the fight over cutting capital-gains taxes </ARG2> , Congress is almost certain to act in time to avoid default .
`` Each day that <ARG1> Congress </ARG1> <fail.01>fails</fail.01> <ARG2> to act </ARG2> ... will cause additional disruption in our borrowing schedule , possibly resulting in higher interest costs to the taxpayer , '' Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in a speech prepared for delivery last night to a group of bankers .
<ARG0> `` To <avoid.01>avoid</avoid.01> <ARG1> these costs , and a possible default </ARG1> , immediate action is imperative . '' </ARG0>
The securities to be <sell.01>sold</sell.01> <ARGM-TMP> next week </ARGM-TMP> will raise about $ 10 billion in cash and redeem $ 20 billion in maturing notes .
<ARG1> The new securities , part of the federal government 's regular quarterly refunding , </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <consist.01>consist</consist.01> of :

-- $ 10 billion of 30-year bonds , to be <auction.02>auctioned</auction.02> <ARGM-TMP> Thursday </ARGM-TMP> and to mature Aug. 15 , 2019 .
<ARG0> The Treasury </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <say.01>said</say.01> it plans to sell $ 10 billion in 36-day cash management bills on Thursday .
<ARG1> They </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <mature.01>mature</mature.01> <ARGM-TMP> Dec. 21 </ARGM-TMP> .
None of the securities will be eligible for when-issued trading until <ARG0> Congress </ARG0> <approve.01>approves</approve.01> <ARG1> an increase in the debt ceiling </ARG1> , <ARGM-ADV> clearing the way for a formal offering </ARGM-ADV> , Mr. Basham said .
<ARG0> The Treasury </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it needs to raise $ 47.5 billion in the current quarter in order to end December with a $ 20 billion cash balance .
<ARG1> Auctions </ARG1> <hold.04>held</hold.04> <ARGM-TMP> in October </ARGM-TMP> and those scheduled for next week will raise a total of $ 25.6 billion .
The <remain.01>remaining</remain.01> <ARG1> $ 21.9 billion </ARG1> could be raised through the sale of short-term Treasury bills , two-year notes in November and five-year notes in early December , the Treasury said .
<ARGM-TMP> In the first three months of 1990 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> the Treasury </ARG0> <estimate.01>estimates</estimate.01> <ARG1> that it will have to raise between $ 45 billion and $ 50 billion </ARG1> , <ARGM-ADV> assuming that it decides to aim for a $ 10 billion cash balance at the end of March </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> Lancaster Colony Corp. </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it acquired Reames Foods Inc. in a cash transaction .
<ARG1> Terms </ARG1> were <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <disclose.01>disclosed</disclose.01> .
Reames , a maker and marketer of <freeze.01>frozen</freeze.01> <ARG1> noodles </ARG1> and pre-cooked pasta based in Clive , Iowa , has annual sales of about $ 11 million , Lancaster said .
<ARG0> Investors </ARG0> <take.01>took</take.01> <ARG1> advantage </ARG1> <ARG2-of> of Tuesday 's stock rally </ARG2-of> <ARGM-PNC> to book some profits </ARGM-PNC> <ARGM-TMP> yesterday </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-ADV> leaving stocks up fractionally </ARGM-ADV> .

<ARG1> Long-term bond prices </ARG1> <rise.01>rose</rise.01> <ARGM-ADV> despite prospects of a huge new supply of Treasury debt this month </ARGM-ADV> .
<continue.01>Continuing</continue.01> <ARG1> demand </ARG1> for dollars from Japanese investors boosted the U.S. currency .

<ARG1> The industrial average </ARG1> <jump.01>jumped</jump.01> <ARG2-EXT> more than 41 points </ARG2-EXT> <ARGM-TMP> Tuesday </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-CAU> as speculators rushed to buy shares of potential takeover targets </ARGM-CAU> .

<ARG1> The offer </ARG1> <follow.XX>follows</follow.XX> <ARG2> an earlier proposal by NL and Mr. Simmons to help Georgia Gulf restructure or go private in a transaction that would pay shareholders $ 55 a share </ARG2> .
<ARG0> Georgia Gulf </ARG0> <rebuff.01>rebuffed</rebuff.01> <ARG1> that offer </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> in September </ARGM-TMP> and said it would study other alternatives .
<ARGM-DIS> However </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> it </ARG0> has <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <ARGM-TMP> yet </ARGM-TMP> <make.XX>made</make.XX> <ARG1> any proposals </ARG1> <ARG2-to> to shareholders </ARG2-to> .
<ARGM-TMP> Late yesterday </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Georgia Gulf </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it reviewed the NL proposal as well as interests from `` third parties '' regarding business combinations .
<ARG0> Georgia Gulf </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it has n't eliminated any alternatives and that `` discussions are being held with interested parties , and work is also continuing on other various transactions . ''
<ARG0> It </ARG0> did <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <elaborate.01>elaborate</elaborate.01> .
<ARG0> Analysts </ARG0> <see.01>saw</see.01> <ARG1> the latest offer as proof that Mr. Simmons , an aggressive and persistent investor , wo n't leave Georgia Gulf alone until some kind of transaction is completed </ARG1> .
`` <ARG0> He </ARG0> has <clamp.01>clamped</clamp.01> <ARG1-on> on their ankle </ARG1-on> <ARGM-MNR> like a pit bull </ARGM-MNR> , '' says Paul Leming , a vice president with Morgan Stanley & Co .
`` He <appear.02>appears</appear.02> to be in it for the long haul . ''
<ARG0> Mr. Simmons and NL </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> already </ARGM-TMP> <own.01>own</own.01> <ARG1> a 9.9 % stake in Georgia Gulf </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Mr. Simmons </ARG0> <own.01>owns</own.01> <ARG1> 88 % of Valhi Inc. , which in turn owns two-thirds of NL </ARG1> .
<ARG0> NL </ARG0> is <ARGM-MNR> officially </ARGM-MNR> <make.03>making</make.03> <ARG1> the offer </ARG1> .
<ARG1> Mr. Leming </ARG1> was <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <surprise.01>surprised</surprise.01> <ARG0-by> by the lower price cited by NL </ARG0-by> , saying he believes that $ 55 a share is `` the most you can pay for Georgia Gulf before it becomes a bad acquisition . ''
<ARG1> Georgia Gulf stock </ARG1> <rise.01>rose</rise.01> <ARG2-EXT> $ 1.75 a share </ARG2-EXT> yesterday <ARGM-PNC> to close at $ 51.25 a share </ARGM-PNC> , <ARGM-TMP> while NL shares closed unchanged at $ 22.75 and Valhi rose 62.5 cents to $ 15 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-LOC> all in New York Stock Exchange composite trading </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG0> J. Landis Martin , NL president and chief executive officer , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> NL and Mr. Simmons cut the price they were proposing for Georgia Gulf because they initially planned a transaction that included about $ 250 million in equity and a substantial amount of high-yield subordinated debt .
<ARGM-DIS> However </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG1> the junk-bond market </ARG1> has <collapse.01>collapsed</collapse.01> <ARGM-TMP> in recent weeks </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-ADV> lessening the likelihood that such a transaction would succeed </ARGM-ADV> .
Now , <ARG0> he </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> , the group plans to put in `` several hundred million '' dollars in equity and finance the remainder with bank debt .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that the group reduced its offer because it was n't allowed to see Georgia Gulf 's confidential financial information without agreeing that it would n't make an offer unless it had Georgia Gulf 's consent </ARG1> .
<ARGM-LOC> In a letter to <ARG2> Georgia Gulf </ARG2> President Jerry R. Satrum </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> Mr. Martin </ARG0> <ask.02>asked</ask.02> Georgia Gulf <ARG1> to answer its offer by Tuesday </ARG1> .
It was n't clear how <ARG0> NL and Mr. Simmons </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <respond.01>respond</respond.01> <ARGM-ADV> if Georgia Gulf spurns them again </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> Mr. Martin </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> they have n't yet decided what their next move would be , but he did n't rule out the possibility of a consent solicitation aimed at replacing Georgia Gulf 's board .
<ARGM-LOC> In other transactions </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> Mr. Simmons </ARG0> has <follow.01>followed</follow.01> <ARG1> friendly offers </ARG1> <ARG2-with> with a hostile tender offer </ARG2-with> .
Although <ARG0> Georgia Gulf </ARG0> has n't been eager to <negotiate.01>negotiate</negotiate.01> <ARG1-with> with Mr. Simmons and NL , a specialty chemicals concern , </ARG1-with> the group apparently believes the company 's management is interested in some kind of transaction .
<ARG0> The management group </ARG0> <own.01>owns</own.01> <ARG1> about 18 % of the stock , most purchased at nominal prices , </ARG1> and would stand to gain millions of dollars if the company were sold .
<ARGM-TMP> In the third quarter </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Georgia Gulf </ARG0> <earn.01>earned</earn.01> <ARG1> $ 46.1 million , or $ 1.85 a share , </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> down from $ 53 million , or $ 1.85 a share on fewer shares outstanding </ARGM-ADV> .

<ARG1> Criticism in the U.S. over recent Japanese acquisitions </ARG1> is <loom.01>looming</loom.01> <ARGM-MNR> ever larger </ARGM-MNR> <ARGM-LOC> in the two countries ' relations </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG0> Officials from both nations </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> the U.S. public 's skittishness about Japanese investment could color a second round of bilateral economic talks scheduled for next week in Washington .
Not that <ARG0> Washington and Tokyo </ARG0> <disagree.01>disagree</disagree.01> <ARG2-on> on the Japanese acquisitions </ARG2-on> ; indeed , each has come out in favor of unfettered investment in the U.S. .
<ARGM-LOC> Where </ARGM-LOC> <ARG0> they </ARG0> <disagree.01>disagree</disagree.01> is on the subject of U.S. direct investment in Japan .
<ARG0> The U.S. </ARG0> <want.01>wants</want.01> <ARG1> the removal of what it perceives as barriers to investment </ARG1> ; Japan denies there are real barriers .
<ARG1> The heated talk </ARG1> <stir.04>stirred</stir.04> up <ARG0-by> by recent Japanese investments in the U.S. </ARG0-by> is focusing attention on the differences in investment climate , even though it 's only one of many subjects to be covered in the bilateral talks , known as the Structural Impediments Initiative .
<ARG0> The Japanese </ARG0> `` <ARGM-MOD> should </ARGM-MOD> <see.01>see</see.01> <ARG1> this rhetoric as a signal of the need for a change in their own economy </ARG1> , '' says Charles Dallara , U.S. assistant Treasury secretary , who has been in Tokyo this week informally discussing the impending negotiations with government and business leaders .
`` <ARG0> We </ARG0> <have.03>have</have.03> <ARG1> a long history of maintaining an open direct-investment policy </ARG1> , '' Mr. Dallara says .
`` <ARG0> U.S. investors </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> should </ARGM-MOD> <have.03>have</have.03> <ARG1> a greater opportunity at direct investment '' in Japan </ARG1> .
<ARG1> One clear sign of Japan 's nervousness </ARG1> <come.01>came</come.01> <ARGM-TMP> this week </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-TMP> when a spokesman for Japan 's Foreign Ministry devoted nearly all of a regular , half-hour briefing for foreign journalists to the subject of recent Japanese investments in the U.S. </ARGM-TMP> .
`` <ARG0> We </ARG0> <believe.01>believe</believe.01> <ARG1> that it is vitally important for those Japanese business interests -LCB- in the U.S. . -RCB- to be more aware of the emotions and concerns of the American people </ARG1> , '' said the spokesman , Taizo Watanabe .
<ARGM-TMP> At the same time </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-DIS> though </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> he </ARG0> <chastise.01>chastised</chastise.01> <ARG1> the media </ARG1> <ARG2-for> for paying such close attention to Japanese investment when other foreign countries , notably Britain , are acquiring more American assets </ARG2-for> .
Fears that <ARG0> Japanese investors </ARG0> are <buy.02>buying</buy.02> up <ARG1> America </ARG1> have escalated sharply in the past several weeks , with Sony Corp. 's purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. from Coca-Cola Co. and Mitsubishi Estate Co. 's acquisition of a 51 % holding in Rockefeller Group , the owner of some of midtown Manhattan 's most exclusive real estate .
Even before <ARG0> those moves </ARG0> <add.02>added</add.02> <ARG1> fuel </ARG1> , the fires of discontent had been well stoked by the highly publicized experience in Japan of one U.S. investor , T. Boone Pickens Jr .
<ARG0> The Texas oilman </ARG0> has <acquire.01>acquired</acquire.01> <ARG1> a 26.2 % stake valued at more than $ 1.2 billion in an automotive-lighting company , Koito Manufacturing Co </ARG1> .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG1> he </ARG1> has <fail.01>failed</fail.01> <ARG2> to gain any influence at the company </ARG2> .
<ARG0> Koito </ARG0> has <refuse.01>refused</refuse.01> <ARG1> to grant Mr. Pickens seats on its board </ARG1> , asserting he is a greenmailer trying to pressure Koito 's other shareholders into buying him out at a profit .
<ARG0> Mr. Pickens </ARG0> <make.01>made</make.01> <ARG1> considerable political hay </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> with his troubles in Japan </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG1> The Senate Finance Committee </ARG1> , <chair.01>chaired</chair.01> <ARG0-by> by a fellow Texan , Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen , </ARG0-by> last month urged U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills to use Mr. Pickens 's experience in talks with Tokyo `` to highlight this problem facing Americans who seek access to the Japanese capital markets . ''
While <ARG0> Mr. Dallara and Japanese officials </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> the question of investors ' access to the U.S. and Japanese markets may get a disproportionate share of the public 's attention , a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next week 's talks .
<ARG0> Each side </ARG0> <have.03>has</have.03> <ARG1> a litany of recommendations for the other </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The U.S. </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> it is anxious for results .
`` <ARG0> We </ARG0> <feel.02>feel</feel.02> <ARGM-MNR> very strongly </ARGM-MNR> that we really need action across the full range of issues we 've identified , and we need it by next spring , '' Mr. Dallara says .
<ARG0> Both sides </ARG0> have <agree.01>agreed</agree.01> <ARG1> that the talks will be most successful if negotiators start by focusing on the areas that can be most easily changed </ARG1> .
But <ARG0> they </ARG0> have <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <clarify.01>clarified</clarify.01> <ARG1> what those might be </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> After the first set of meetings two months ago </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> some U.S. officials </ARG0> <complain.01>complained</complain.01> that Japan had n't come up with specific changes it was prepared to make .
<ARG0> The Japanese retort that the first round was too early to <make.XX>make</make.XX> <ARG1> concessions </ARG1> . </ARG0>
<ARG0> `` Just to <say.01>say</say.01> the distribution system is wrong does n't mean anything , '' says a Ministry of International Trade and Industry official . </ARG0>
`` <ARG0> We </ARG0> <need.01>need</need.01> <ARG1> to clarify what exactly is wrong with it </ARG1> . ''
<ARG0> That process of <sort.02>sorting</sort.02> out <ARG1> specifics </ARG1> is likely to take time , the Japanese say , no matter how badly the U.S. wants quick results . </ARG0>
<ARGM-DIS> For instance </ARGM-DIS> , <ARGM-LOC> at the first meeting </ARGM-LOC> <ARG0> the two sides </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> even <agree.01>agree</agree.01> <ARG1-on> on basic data used in price discussions </ARG1-on> .
<ARGM-TMP> Since then </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> a team of about 15 MITI and U.S. Commerce Department officials </ARG0> have <cross.02>crossed</cross.02> <ARG1> the globe </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> gauging consumer prices </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARGM-TMP> By Monday </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> they </ARG0> <hope.01>hope</hope.01> to have a sheaf of documents both sides can trust .
`` <ARG1> Little by little , there is progress </ARG1> , '' <say.01>says</say.01> <ARG0> the MITI official </ARG0> .

While worry <grow.01>grows</grow.01> about big Japanese investments in the U.S. , Japan 's big trading companies are rapidly increasing their stake in America 's smaller business .
<ARGM-ADV> For Japan </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> the controversial trend </ARG0> <improve.01>improves</improve.01> <ARG1> access to American markets and technology </ARG1> .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG2-for> for small American companies </ARG2-for> , <ARG0> it </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <provide.01>provides</provide.01> <ARG1> a growing source of capital and even marketing help </ARG1> .
<take.01><ARG0></take.01> <ARG1> the deal with Candela Laser Corp. , a Wayland , Mass. , manufacturer of high-tech medical devices , which three years ago set its sights on Japan as an export market </ARG1> . </ARG0>
<ARGM-ADV> Partly </ARGM-ADV> to <help.01>help</help.01> <ARG1> clear the myriad obstacles facing any overseas company trying to penetrate Japan </ARG1> , <ARG0> tiny Candela </ARG0> turned to Mitsui & Co. , one of Japan 's largest trading companies , for investment .
<ARGM-LOC> In a joint-venture deal </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> Mitsui </ARG0> <guide.01>guided</guide.01> <ARG1> Candela </ARG1> <ARG2-through> through Tokyo 's bureaucratic maze </ARG2-through> .
<ARG0> It </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> eventually </ARGM-TMP> <secure.01>secured</secure.01> <ARG1> Ministry of Health import approval for two Candela laser products -- one that breaks up kidney stones and another that treats skin lesions </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> At last count </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Candela </ARG0> had <sell.01>sold</sell.01> <ARG1> $ 4 million of its medical devices </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> in Japan </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG0> The deal </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <give.01>gave</give.01> <ARG2> Mitsui </ARG2> <ARG1> access to a high-tech medical product </ARG1> .
`` <ARG0> They </ARG0> <view.02>view</view.02> <ARG1> this </ARG1> <ARG2-as> as a growth area </ARG2-as> so they went about it with a systematic approach , '' says Richard Olsen , a Candela vice president .
Indeed , for many Japanese trading companies , the favorite U.S. small business is one <ARG2> whose research and development </ARG2> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> be <milk.01>milked</milk.01> <ARGM-PNC> for future Japanese use </ARGM-PNC> .
<ARG0> The Japanese companies </ARG0> <bankroll.01>bankroll</bankroll.01> <ARG1> many small U.S. companies with promising products or ideas </ARG1> , <ARGM-ADV> frequently putting their money behind projects that commercial banks wo n't touch </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> Japanese companies </ARG0> have <finance.01>financed</finance.01> <ARG1> small and medium-sized U.S. firms </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> for years </ARGM-TMP> , but in recent months , the pace has taken off .
<ARGM-TMP> In the first half of 1989 alone </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Japanese corporations </ARG0> <invest.01>invested</invest.01> <ARG1> $ 214 million </ARG1> <ARG2-in> in minority positions in U.S. companies </ARG2-in> , <ARGM-ADV> a 61 % rise from the figure for all of 1987 </ARGM-ADV> , reports Venture Economics Inc .
<ARG0> The Needham , Mass. , concern </ARG0> <track.01>tracks</track.01> <ARG1> investments in new businesses </ARG1> .
<ARGM-DIS> In addition </ARGM-DIS> , of course , <ARG2> some of the Japanese investments </ARG2> <involve.01>involved</involve.01> <ARG1> outright purchase of small U.S. firms </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Heightened Japanese interest in American small business </ARG0> <parallel.01>parallels</parallel.01> <ARG1> an acceleration of investments giving Japanese companies control of large , highly visible U.S. corporations , such as Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> Only this week </ARGM-TMP> , it was <announce.01>announced</announce.01> <ARG1> that Mitsubishi Estate Co. had acquired a 51 % stake in Rockefeller Group , which owns New York 's prestigious Rockefeller Center </ARG1> .
<ARGM-ADV> While the small deals are far less conspicuous </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> they </ARG0> <add.02>add</add.02> <ARG2-to> to Japanese penetration of the U.S. market </ARG2-to> .
As <ARG0> the deals </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <improve.01>improve</improve.01> <ARG1> Japanese access to American technology and market knowledge </ARG1> , they feed American anxieties in this area , too .
<ARG0> Even a low-tech product like plate glass </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <catch.01>catch</catch.01> <ARG1> a trading company 's fancy </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> if there 's a strategic fit </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG1> Free State Glass Industries of Warrenton , Va. , a small fabricator of architectural glass , </ARG1> was <founder.01>foundering</founder.01> <ARG2-under> under its original management </ARG2-under> .
<ARGM-TMP> Last year </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Mitsubishi International Corp. , the New York-based arm of Mitsubishi Corp. , </ARG0> <buy.01>bought</buy.01> <ARG1> controlling interest in the glass company </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> in a joint venture with Ronald Bodner , a glass industry executive and Mitsubishi consultant </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG1> The deal </ARG1> is <ARGM-MNR> chiefly </ARGM-MNR> <design.01>designed</design.01> <ARG3> to give Mitsubishi a window on the U.S. glass industry </ARG3> , says Ichiro Wakui , an executive in Mitsubishi 's general merchandise department in New York .
`` <ARG1> It 's not just a simple investment in a small company </ARG1> , '' <ARG0> Mr. Wakui </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> .
`` <ARG0> We </ARG0> <want.01>want</want.01> <ARG1> to see the glass market from the inside , not the outside </ARG1> . ''
<ARG1> Mitsubishi 's investment in Free State is `` very small ... less than $ 4 million </ARG1> , '' <ARG0> Mr. Wakui </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> .
<ARG0> Mr. Bodner </ARG0> <decline.02>declines</decline.02> <ARG1> to comment on the arrangement </ARG1> .
Trading companies such as Mitsubishi , Mitsui , C. Itoh & Co. and Nissho-Iwai Corp. , which <make.01>make</make.01> <ARG1> many of the Japanese investments in small U.S. concerns </ARG1> , have no U.S. counterpart .
These <ARGM-MNR> vertically </ARGM-MNR> <integrate.01>integrated</integrate.01> <ARG1> combines </ARG1> , some of which got their start in Japan 's feudal period , deal globally in commodities , construction and manufacturing .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <operate.01>operate</operate.01> <ARG1> ships and banks </ARG1> .
`` <ARG0> All the `` sogo-shosha '' </ARG0> are <look.01>looking</look.01> <ARG1-for> for new business </ARG1-for> , '' says Arthur Klauser , adviser to the president of Mitsui , U.S.A. , using the Japanese term for the largest of the global trading houses .
<add.01>Adds</add.01> <ARG0> Takeshi Kondo , senior vice president of C. Itoh America Inc. </ARG0> : `` <ARG1> We have a great interest in making investments , particularly in new ventures </ARG1> . ''
<ARG1> A host of electronics firms in California 's Silicon Valley </ARG1> were <finance.01>financed</finance.01> <ARG2-with> with trading-company venture capital </ARG2-with> .
`` <ARG0> Strategic objectives , not financial return , </ARG0> <drive.02>drive</drive.02> <ARG1> many of the deals </ARG1> , '' says a Venture Economics spokesman .
In <invest.01>investing</invest.01> <ARGM-MNR> on the basis of future transactions </ARGM-MNR> , a role often performed by merchant banks , <ARG0> trading companies </ARG0> can cut through the logjam that small-company owners often face with their local commercial banks .
`` <ARG1> It 's the classic problem of the small businessman </ARG1> , '' <say.01>says</say.01> <ARG0> Malcolm Davies , managing director of Trading Alliance Corp. of New York </ARG0> .
`` <ARG0> People </ARG0> are <queue.01>queuing</queue.01> <ARGM-LOC> at the door </ARGM-LOC> <ARGM-PNC> to take his product </ARGM-PNC> but he does n't have the working capital to make the thing and commercial banks are very unsympathetic .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <want.01>want</want.01> <ARG1> assets </ARG1> , they want a balance sheet , which has no relation to the business a company can generate . ''
<add.01>Adds</add.01> <ARG0> Mitsui 's Mr. Klauser </ARG0> : `` <ARG1> Unlike corporations in this country , trading companies are n't so much interested in a high return on investment as they are on increasing trade flows </ARG1> .
To the extent <ARG0> they </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <do.02>do</do.02> <ARG1> this </ARG1> , they 're quite content to get a return on investment of 1 % to 2 % . ''
<ARG0> Mr. Klauser </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> Mitsui has 75 U.S. subsidiaries in which it holds 35 % interest or more and the trading company hopes to double the number of its U.S. affiliates in 1990 .
Sales by these subsidiaries in <ARG1> the fiscal year </ARG1> <end.01>ending</end.01> <ARGM-TMP> last March </ARGM-TMP> were more than $ 17 billion .
<ARG1> A 1 % to 2 % return on $ 17 billion `` ai n't hay </ARG1> , '' <ARG0> Mr. Klauser </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> .
<ARG0> Hudson General Corp. 's president and chief executive officer , Alan J. Stearn , </ARG0> <resign.XX>resigned</resign.XX> .
<ARG1> Mr. Stearn , 46 years old , </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> be <reach.02>reached</reach.02> <ARGM-PNC> for comment </ARGM-PNC> .
<ARG0> A company spokesman </ARG0> <decline.02>declined</decline.02> <ARG1> to elaborate on the departure </ARG1> .
Hudson General , which <provide.01>provides</provide.01> <ARG1> maintenance , fueling and other services </ARG1> <ARG2-to> to airlines and airports </ARG2-to> , reported a loss for its most recent fiscal year and last month omitted the semiannual dividend on its common shares .
<ARG0> Mr. Stearn , who had been with the company more than 20 years and had been president since 1984 , </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <act.01>act</act.01> <ARG1-as> as a consultant to Hudson General </ARG1-as> .

<ARGM-TMP> For 10 years </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Genie Driskill </ARG0> <go.02>went</go.02> <ARG4-to> to her neighborhood bank </ARG4-to> <ARGM-CAU> because it was convenient </ARGM-CAU> .
<ARG1-for> A high-balance customer that </ARG1-for> <ARG0> banks </ARG0> <pine.01>pine</pine.01> for , she did n't give much thought to the rates she was receiving , nor to the fees she was paying .
But <ARGM-TMP> in August </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> First Atlanta National Bank </ARG0> <introduce.02>introduced</introduce.02> <ARG1> its Crown Account , a package designed to lure customers such as Ms. Driskill </ARG1> .
<ARGM-ADV> Among other things </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG2> it </ARG2> <include.01>included</include.01> <ARG1> checking , safe deposit box and credit card -- all for free -- plus a good deal on installment loans </ARG1> .
All she <have.02>had</have.02> to do was put $ 15,000 in a certificate of deposit , or qualify for a $ 10,000 personal line of credit .
`` <ARG0> I </ARG0> <deserve.01>deserve</deserve.01> <ARG1> something </ARG1> <ARG2-for> for my loyalty </ARG2-for> , '' she says .
<ARG0> She </ARG0> <take.01>took</take.01> <ARG1> her business </ARG1> <ARGM-DIR> to First Atlanta </ARGM-DIR> .
<ARGM-MNR> So </ARGM-MNR> <ARG1> it </ARG1> <go.XX>goes</go.XX> <ARGM-LOC> in the competitive world of consumer banking </ARGM-LOC> <ARGM-TMP> these days </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARGM-TMP> For nearly a decade </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> banks </ARG0> have <compete.01>competed</compete.01> <ARG2-for> for customers </ARG2-for> primarily with the interest rates they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans .
<ARG1> The competitive rates </ARG1> were <ARGM-ADV> generally </ARGM-ADV> <offset.01>offset</offset.01> <ARG2-by> by hefty fees on various services </ARG2-by> .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG1> many banks </ARG1> are <turn.04>turning</turn.04> away <ARG2-from> from strict price competition </ARG2-from> .
<ARGM-DIS> Instead </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> they </ARG0> are <try.01>trying</try.01> <ARG1> to build customer loyalty by bundling their services into packages and targeting them to small segments of the population </ARG1> .
`` You 're dead in the water if <ARG0> you </ARG0> are <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <segment.01>segmenting</segment.01> <ARG1> the market </ARG1> , '' says Anne Moore , president of Synergistics Research Corp. , a bank consulting firm in Atlanta .
<ARG0> NCNB Corp. of Charlotte , N.C. , </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> recently </ARGM-TMP> <introduce.02>introduced</introduce.02> <ARG1> its Financial Connections Program aimed at young adults just starting careers </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The program </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> not only </ARGM-ADV> <offer.01>offers</offer.01> <ARG1> a pre-approved car loan up to $ 18,000 </ARG1> , but throws in a special cash-flow statement to help in saving money .
<ARGM-TMP> In September </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Union Planters Corp. of Memphis , Tenn. , </ARG0> <launch.01>launched</launch.01> <ARG1> The Edge account , a package designed for the `` thirtysomething '' crowd with services that include a credit card and line of credit with no annual fees , and a full percentage point off on installment loans </ARG1> .
The theory : Such individuals , many with young children , are in their prime borrowing years -- and , having <borrow.01>borrowed</borrow.01> <ARG2-from> from the bank </ARG2-from> , <ARG0> they </ARG0> may continue to use it for other services in later years .
<ARGM-TMP> For some time </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> banks </ARG0> have been <aim.02>aiming</aim.02> <ARG1> packages </ARG1> <ARG2-at> at the elderly , the demographic segment with the highest savings </ARG2-at> .
<ARG1> Those efforts </ARG1> are being <step.03>stepped</step.03> up .
<ARG0> Judie MacDonald , vice president of retail sales at Barnett Banks Inc. of Jacksonville , Fla. , </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> the company now targets sub-segments within the market by tailoring its popular Seniors Partners Program to various life styles .
`` <ARG0> Varying age , geography and life-style differences </ARG0> <create.01>create</create.01> <ARG1> numerous sub-markets </ARG1> , '' Ms. MacDonald says .
<ARG0> She </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> individual Barnett branches can add different benefits to their Seniors Partners package -- such as athletic activities or travel clubs -- to appeal to local market interests .
`` <ARG0> An active 55-year-old in Boca Raton </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> may </ARGM-MOD> <care.01>care</care.01> <ARGM-EXT> more </ARGM-EXT> <ARG1-about> about Senior Olympic games </ARG1-about> , <ARGM-ADV> while a 75-year-old in Panama City may care more about a seminar on health </ARGM-ADV> , '' she says .
<ARG0> Banks </ARG0> have <try.01>tried</try.01> <ARG1> packaging </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> before </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARGM-TMP> In 1973 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Wells Fargo & Co. of San Francisco </ARG0> <launch.01>launched</launch.01> <ARG1> the Gold Account , which included free checking , a credit card , safe-deposit box and travelers checks for a $ 3 monthly fee </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The concept </ARG0> <beget.01>begot</beget.01> <ARG1> a slew of copycats </ARG1> , but the banks stopped promoting the packages .
<ARG0> Many banks , particularly smaller ones , </ARG0> were slow to <computerize.01>computerize</computerize.01> and could n't target market niches that would have made the programs more profitable .
As <ARG1> banks ' earnings </ARG1> were <squeeze.03>squeezed</squeeze.03> <ARGM-TMP> in the mid-1970s </ARGM-TMP> , the emphasis switched to finding ways to cut costs .
But <ARGM-TMP> now </ARGM-TMP> <ARG0> computers </ARG0> are <enable.01>enabling</enable.01> <ARG1> more banks to analyze their customers by age , income and geography </ARG1> .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> are better able to <get.05>get</get.05> <ARG1-to> to those segments </ARG1-to> <ARGM-TMP> in the wake of the deregulation that began in the late 1970s </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> Deregulation </ARG0> has <ARGM-ADV> effectively </ARGM-ADV> <remove.01>removed</remove.01> <ARG1> all restrictions on what banks can pay for deposits </ARG1> , as well as opened up the field for new products such as high-rate CDs .
<ARGM-LOC> Where </ARGM-LOC> <ARG0> a bank </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> once </ARGM-TMP> <offer.01>offered</offer.01> <ARG1> a standard passbook savings account </ARG1> , it began offering money-market accounts , certificates of deposit and interest-bearing checking , and staggering rates based on the size of deposits .
<ARG1> The competition </ARG1> has <grow.02>grown</grow.02> <ARG2> more intense </ARG2> <ARGM-TMP> as bigger banks such as Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis and Chemical Banking Corp. of New York extend their market-share battles into small towns across the nation </ARGM-TMP> .
`` <ARGM-TMP> Today </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> a banker </ARG0> is <worry.02>worrying</worry.02> <ARG1-about> about local , regional and money-center -LCB- banks -RCB- , as well as thrifts and credit unions </ARG1-about> , '' says Ms. Moore at Synergistics Research .
`` So <ARG0> people who </ARG0> were <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <ARGM-ADV> even </ARGM-ADV> <think.01>thinking</think.01> <ARG2-about> about targeting </ARG2-about> <ARGM-TMP> 10 years ago </ARGM-TMP> are scrambling to define their customer base . ''
<ARG0> The competition </ARG0> has <cultivate.01>cultivated</cultivate.01> <ARG1> a much savvier consumer </ARG1> .
`` <ARG0> The average household </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <spread.03>spread</spread.03> <ARG1> 19 accounts </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> over a dozen financial institutions </ARGM-LOC> , '' says Michael P. Sullivan , who runs his own bank consulting firm in Charlotte , N.C .
`` <ARG0> This much fragmentation </ARG0> <make.02>makes</make.02> <ARG1> attracting and keeping today 's rate-sensitive customers </ARG1> <ARG2> costly </ARG2> . ''
<ARG0> Packages </ARG0> <encourage.02>encourage</encourage.02> <ARG1> loyalty </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place </ARGM-MNR> .
<ARG3-For> For their troubles </ARG3-For> , <ARG0> the banks </ARG0> <get.01>get</get.01> <ARG1> a larger captive audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate </ARG1> .
The more accounts <ARG0> customers </ARG0> <have.03>have</have.03> , Mr. Sullivan says , the more likely they are to be attracted to a package -- and to be loyal to the bank that offers it .
<ARG1> That </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <pay.05>pay</pay.05> off <ARGM-TMP> down the road </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-ADV> as customers , especially the younger ones , change from borrowers to savers\/investors </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> Packaging </ARG0> <have.03>has</have.03> <ARG1> some drawbacks </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Chemical Bank </ARG0> <spend.01>spent</spend.01> <ARG3> more than $ 50 million </ARG3> <ARGM-PNC> to introduce its ChemPlus line , several packages aimed at different segments , </ARGM-PNC> <ARGM-TMP> in 1986 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-ADV> according to Thomas Jacob , senior vice president of marketing </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> `` It 's not easy to <roll.02>roll</roll.02> out <ARG1> something that comprehensive </ARG1> , and make it pay , '' Mr. Jacob says . </ARG0>
<ARGM-ADV> Still </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> bankers </ARG0> <expect.01>expect</expect.01> <ARG1> packaging to flourish </ARG1> , <ARGM-CAU> primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs </ARGM-CAU> .
`` <ARGM-TMP> These days </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> banking customers </ARG0> <walk.01>walk</walk.01> <ARGM-DIR> in the door </ARGM-DIR> <ARGM-ADV> expecting you to have a package especially for them </ARGM-ADV> , '' Ms. Moore says .
<ARG1> Some banks </ARG1> are <ARGM-TMP> already </ARGM-TMP> <move.01>moving</move.01> <ARGM-DIR> in that direction </ARGM-DIR> , according to Alvin T. Sale , marketing director at First Union Corp. in Charlotte .
First Union , <ARG0> he </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> , now has packages for seven customer groups .
<ARGM-TMP> Soon </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> it </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <split.01>split</split.01> <ARG1> those </ARG1> <ARG2-into> into 30 </ARG2-into> .
<say.01>Says</say.01> <ARG0> Mr. Sale </ARG0> : `` I think more banks are starting to realize that we have to be more like the department store , not the boutique . ''

<ARG0> The Chicago Mercantile Exchange </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it plans to institute an additional `` circuit breaker '' aimed at stemming market slides .
<ARGM-ADV> Separately </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> John Phelan </ARG0> <tell.01>told</tell.01> <ARG2> a closed House subcommittee meeting in Washington </ARG2> <ARG1> that he would support Securities and Exchange Commission halts of program trading during market emergencies </ARG1> .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> the New York Stock Exchange chairman </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> he does n't support reinstating a `` collar '' on program trading , <ARGM-ADV> arguing that firms could get around such a limit </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> The Chicago Merc </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> a new one-hour price limit would take effect in its Standard & Poor 's 500 stock-index futures pit once S&P 500 futures fell 20 index points -- the equivalent of about a 150-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
If <ARG1> the 20-point limit </ARG1> is <trigger.01>triggered</trigger.01> <ARGM-TMP> after 1:30 p.m . Chicago time </ARGM-TMP> , it would remain in effect until the normal close of trading at 3:15 p.m .
With the limit in effect , <ARG0> members </ARG0> would be able to <execute.02>execute</execute.02> <ARG1> trades </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> at the limit price or at higher prices , but not below it </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG0> The exchange </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it decided a new circuit breaker was needed following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stock-index futures on Friday Oct. 13 , when the Dow Jones industrials plunged 190 points and stock-index futures prices skidded as well .
<ARGM-TMP> Late </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-TMP> that afternoon </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> the S&P 500 stock-index futures contract </ARG1> <fall.01>fell</fall.01> <ARG2-EXT> a total of 30 index points </ARG2-EXT> , <ARGM-ADV> hitting a Merc circuit breaker limit that remained in effect for the rest of the trading session </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> The Merc </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that its existing 30-minute , 12-point limit on S&P 500 stock-index futures trading -LRB- equal to about 100 points on the Dow Jones industrials -RRB- , which was triggered Oct. 13 , will remain in effect </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Leo Melamed , Merc executive committee chairman , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that the 12-point limit appeared to lessen the selling panic Oct. 13 </ARG1> .
But <ARGM-TMP> when </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> the contract </ARG1> <reopen.01>reopened</reopen.01> , the subsequent flood of sell orders that quickly knocked the contract down to the 30-point limit indicated that the intermediate limit of 20 points was needed to help keep stock and stock-index futures prices synchronized .
<ARG0> Several traders </ARG0> <maintain.01>maintained</maintain.01> <ARG1> that the Merc 's 12-point circuit-breaker aggravated the market slide Oct. 13 by directing additional selling pressure to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange </ARG1> .
<ARG0> All of the changes </ARG0> <require.01>require</require.01> <ARG1> regulatory approval , which is expected shortly </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The exchange </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that the 30-point circuit breaker , which currently provides only a one-hour respite during market sell-offs , will become the maximum one-day limit for the S&P 500 stock-index futures contract </ARG1> ; the one-day limit now is 50 index points .
<ARG1> A final modification </ARG1> was <make.01>made</make.01> <ARG3-to> to the five-point opening limit for the contract </ARG3-to> .
<ARG0> The Merc </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> that five-point limit will remain in effect for the first 10 minutes of trading .
<ARG1> The limit </ARG1> <lapse.01>lapses</lapse.01> <ARGM-LOC> under current exchange rules </ARGM-LOC> <ARGM-ADV> if contracts trade above the limit price during the opening 10 minutes of trading </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARGM-LOC> In Washington </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> House aides </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> Mr. Phelan told congressmen that the collar , which banned program trades through the Big Board 's computer when the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 50 points , did n't work well .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that firms could get around the collar by executing trades manually </ARG1> .
In a post-hearing news conference , Mr. Phelan , who has <ARGM-MNR> publicly </ARGM-MNR> <express.01>expressed</express.01> <ARG1> concern about market volatility </ARG1> , said he told the House finance and telecommunications subcommittee that he would support the program-trading halt proposal `` providing the SEC would be comfortable with the language '' in a bill .
<ARG1> The program-trading issue </ARG1> is <heat.02>heating</heat.02> up <ARGM-LOC> on Capitol Hill </ARGM-LOC> <ARGM-MNR> as it is on Wall Street </ARGM-MNR> , and several legislators want to grant the SEC the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile .
<ARG0> SEC Chairman Richard Breeden </ARG0> has <say.01>said</say.01> he would be willing to consider circuit breakers that have preset trigger points , but he does n't want discretionary power to stop programs .
<ARG0> A House aide </ARG0> <suggest.01>suggested</suggest.01> <ARG1> that Mr. Phelan was so `` vague and mushy '' that it was the kind of meeting where people of all viewpoints could `` come out feeling good </ARG1> . ''
<ARGM-TMP> At one point </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Mr. Phelan </ARG0> <anger.01>angered</anger.01> <ARG1> the subcommittee 's chairman , Rep. Edward Markey -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the morning newspapers </ARGM-MNR> .
`` <ARG0> Markey </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> we could have done this in public '' because so little sensitive information was disclosed , the aide said .
<ARG0> Mr. Phelan </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> then </ARGM-TMP> <respond.01>responded</respond.01> <ARG2> that he would have been happy just writing a report to the panel </ARG2> , the aide added .
<ARGM-TMP> At another point </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-TMP> during the hearing </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Rep. Markey </ARG0> <ask.01>asked</ask.01> <ARG2> Mr. Phelan </ARG2> <ARG1> what would be discussed at a New York exchange board meeting today </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Mr. Phelan </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the Big Board is likely to study the program-trading issue .
<ARG0> That response </ARG0> <annoy.01>annoyed</annoy.01> <ARG1> Rep. Markey </ARG1> , House aides said , and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter .
Fifteen of the 26 subcommittee members <attend.01>attended</attend.01> <ARG1> the hearing </ARG1> , most notably Rep. John Dingell -LRB- D. , Mich. -RRB- , the full House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman , who has been willing to let Mr. Markey carry the legislation in recent months .
<ARG0> Mr. Dingell </ARG0> <express.01>expressed</express.01> concern , sources said , about jurisdictional problems in regulating program trading , which uses futures to offset stock trades .
<ARG1> The futures industry </ARG1> is <regulate.01>regulated</regulate.01> <ARG0-by> by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which reports to the Agriculture committees in both houses </ARG0-by> .
-- Of <ARG0> all scenes that </ARG0> <evoke.01>evoke</evoke.01> <ARG1> rural England </ARG1> , this is one of the loveliest : An ancient stone church stands amid the fields , the sound of bells cascading from its tower , calling the faithful to evensong .
<ARG1> The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels </ARG1> <stop.01>stop</stop.01> <ARGM-PNC> to chat </ARGM-PNC> <ARGM-LOC> at the church door </ARGM-LOC> , <ARGM-ADV> as members here always have </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARGM-LOC> In the tower </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> five men and women </ARG0> <pull.01>pull</pull.01> <ARGM-MNR> rhythmically </ARGM-MNR> <ARG1-on> on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614 </ARG1-on> .
But there is also a discordant , modern note in Aslacton , though <ARG1> it </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> ca </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> be <hear.01>heard</hear.01> <ARG0-by> by the church-goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening </ARG0-by> .
<ARGM-ADV> Like most of the other 6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> St. Michael </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> once </ARGM-TMP> <have.03>had</have.03> <ARG1> its own `` band '' of ringers , who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> Now </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> only one local ringer </ARG1> <remain.01>remains</remain.01> : 64-year-old Derek Hammond .
<ARG0> The others here </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> today </ARGM-TMP> <live.01>live</live.01> <ARGM-LOC> elsewhere </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <belong.01>belong</belong.01> <ARG1-to> to a group of 15 ringers -- including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training -- who drive every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes-exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia </ARG1-to> .
`` To <ring.01>ring</ring.01> <ARG2-for> for even one service </ARG2-for> <ARGM-LOC> at this tower </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> we </ARG0> have to scrape , '' says Mr. Hammond , a retired water-authority worker .
`` <ARG0> We </ARG0> 've <try.01>tried</try.01> <ARG1> to train the youngsters </ARG1> , but they have their discos and their dances , and they just drift away . ''
<ARG0> Mr. Hammond </ARG0> <worry.01>worries</worry.01> <ARG1> that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the East Anglian group that keeps the Aslacton bells pealing </ARG1> .
According to <ARG1> a nationwide survey </ARG1> <take.01>taken</take.01> <ARGM-TMP> a year ago </ARGM-TMP> , nearly a third of England 's church bells are no longer rung on Sundays because there is no one to ring them .
<ARG0> It is easy to <see.01>see</see.01> <ARG1> why the ancient art is on the ropes </ARG1> . </ARG0>
<ARG0> The less complicated version of <play.01>playing</play.01> <ARG1> tunes </ARG1> <ARG2-on> on bells </ARG2-on> , <ARGM-ADV> as do the carillons of continental Europe </ARGM-ADV> , is considered by the English to be childish , fit only for foreigners . </ARG0>
Change-ringing , a mind-boggling exercise <ARG0> the English </ARG0> <invent.01>invented</invent.01> <ARGM-TMP> 380 years ago </ARGM-TMP> , requires physical dexterity -- some bells weigh more than a ton -- combined with intense mental concentration .
Proper English bells are <start.02>started</start.02> off in `` rounds , '' from the highest-pitched bell to the lowest -- a simple descending scale using , in larger churches , as many as 12 bells .
<ARGM-DIS> Then </ARGM-DIS> , <ARGM-TMP> at a signal </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> the ringers </ARG0> <begin.01>begin</begin.01> <ARG1> varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking </ARG1> .
<ARG1> Each variation , or change , </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <occur.01>occur</occur.01> <ARGM-TMP> only once </ARGM-TMP> , the rules state .
<ARG0> Ringers </ARG0> <memorize.01>memorize</memorize.01> <ARG1> patterns of changes , known as `` methods , '' which have odd-sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters </ARG1> .
<ARG0> A series of 5,000 or so changes </ARG0> is a `` peal '' and <take.XX>takes</take.XX> <ARG1> about three hours </ARG1> .
<ARG0> A look at a Thursday night practice at St. Mary Abbot church in the Kensington district of London </ARG0> <give.01>gives</give.01> <ARG1> an idea of the work involved </ARG1> .
<ARG1> Ten shirt-sleeved ringers </ARG1> <stand.01>stand</stand.01> <ARG2-in> in a circle </ARG2-in> , <ARGM-ADV> one foot ahead of the other in a prize-fighter 's stance </ARGM-ADV> , <ARGM-ADV> each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> No one </ARG0> <speak.01>speaks</speak.01> , and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves , muffled by the ceiling .
<ARGM-MNR> Totally </ARGM-MNR> <absorb.01>absorbed</absorb.01> , <ARG1> the ringers </ARG1> stare straight ahead , using peripheral vision -LRB- they call it `` rope-sight '' -RRB- to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls .
Far above in the belfry , <ARG1> the huge bronze bells </ARG1> , <mount.03>mounted</mount.03> <ARGM-LOC> on wheels </ARGM-LOC> , swing madly through a full 360 degrees , starting and ending , surprisingly , in the inverted , or mouth-up position .
<ARG0> Skilled ringers </ARG0> <use.01>use</use.01> <ARG1> their wrists </ARG1> <ARG2-PNC> to advance or retard the next swing </ARG2-PNC> , <ARGM-ADV> so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change </ARGM-ADV> .
In <ARG2> a well-known detective-story </ARG2> <involve.01>involving</involve.01> <ARG1> church bells </ARG1> , English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a `` passion -LCB- that -RCB- finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection . ''
Ringers , <ARG0> she </ARG0> <add.01>added</add.01> , are `` filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed . ''
`` <ARG1> Ringing </ARG1> does <become.01>become</become.01> <ARG2> a bit of an obsession </ARG2> , '' admits Stephanie Pattenden , master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England 's best female ringers .
It is <ARG1> a passion that </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> usually </ARGM-TMP> <stay.01>stays</stay.01> <ARGM-LOC> in the tower </ARGM-LOC> , <ARGM-DIS> however </ARGM-DIS> .
<ARGM-TMP> More often than not </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> ringers </ARG0> <think.01>think</think.01> <ARG2-of> of the church </ARG2-of> <ARG1-as> as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry </ARG1-as> .
When <ARG1> their changes </ARG1> are <complete.01>completed</complete.01> , and after they have worked up a sweat , ringers often skip off to the local pub , leaving worship for others below .
<ARG1> This </ARG1> does <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> <sit.01>sit</sit.01> <ARGM-MNR> well </ARGM-MNR> <ARGM-LOC> with some clerics </ARGM-LOC> .
With <ARG1> membership of the Church of England </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> steadily </ARGM-MNR> <dwindle.01>dwindling</dwindle.01> , strong-willed vicars are pressing equally strong-willed and often non-religious ringers to attend services .
<ARGM-TMP> Two years ago </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone , vicar of Great Torrington , Devon , </ARG1> <get.03>got</get.03> <ARG2> so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service </ARG2> he sacked the entire band ; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest .
`` They were <ARG0> a self-perpetuating club that </ARG0> <treat.01>treated</treat.01> <ARG1> the tower </ARG1> <ARG2-as> as sort of a separate premises </ARG2-as> , '' the Vicar Hummerstone says .
An entirely new band <ring.01>rings</ring.01> <ARGM-TMP> today </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-LOC> at Great Torrington </ARGM-LOC> , several of whom are members of the congregation .
But there still are n't enough ringers to <ring.01>ring</ring.01> <ARG1> more than six of the eight bells </ARG1> .
<ARGM-LOC> At St. Mary 's Church in Ilminster , Somerset </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG1> the bells </ARG1> have <fall.01>fallen</fall.01> <ARG4> silent </ARG4> <ARGM-TMP> following a dust-up over church attendance </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> The vicar , W.D. Jones , </ARG0> <refuse.01>refuses</refuse.01> <ARG1> to talk about it </ARG1> , saying it would `` reopen the wound . ''
But <ARG0> C.J.B. Marshall , vicar of a nearby church , </ARG0> <feel.02>feels</feel.02> the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar .
`` So crunch , crunch , crunch , bang , bang , bang -- <ARGM-DIR> here </ARGM-DIR> <come.01>come</come.01> <ARG1> the ringers </ARG1> <ARG3-from> from above </ARG3-from> , <ARGM-ADV> making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer </ARGM-ADV> , '' he says .
<ARG0> Vicar Marshall </ARG0> <admit.01>admits</admit.01> <ARG1-to> to mixed feelings about this issue </ARG1-to> , <ARGM-CAU> since he is both a vicar and an active bell-ringer himself </ARGM-CAU> .
`` The sound of bells is a net to <draw.02>draw</draw.02> <ARG1> people </ARG1> <ARGM-DIR> into the church </ARGM-DIR> , '' he says .
`` <ARG0> I </ARG0> <live.01>live</live.01> <ARGM-MNR> in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life </ARGM-MNR> . ''
<ARG0> The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers , a sort of parliament of ringing groups , </ARG0> <aim.01>aims</aim.01> <ARG1> to improve relations with vicars </ARG1> , says John C. Baldwin , president .
<ARG0> It </ARG0> <hope.01>hopes</hope.01> <ARG1> to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing </ARG1> and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled , `` The Bells in Your Care . ''
<say.01>Says</say.01> <ARG0> Mr. Baldwin </ARG0> , `` <ARG1> We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience </ARG1> . ''
<ARG0> Mr. Baldwin </ARG0> is <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <attack.01>attacking</attack.01> <ARG1> the greater problem : lack of ringers </ARG1> .
<ARG0> One survey </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> <ARG1> that of the 100,000 trained bellringers in England today , only 40,000 of them still ring </ARG1> .
<ARGM-ADV> Also </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> ringers </ARG0> do <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <ARGM-TMP> always </ARGM-TMP> <live.01>live</live.01> <ARGM-LOC> where the bells need to be rung -- like in small , rural parishes and inner-city churches </ARGM-LOC> .
But <ARG0> the council 's </ARG0> program to <attract.01>attract</attract.01> and train <ARG1> ringers </ARG1> is only partly successful , says Mr. Baldwin .
`` Right now , <ARG0> we </ARG0> 're lucky if <ARGM-TMP> after five years </ARGM-TMP> we <keep.01>keep</keep.01> <ARG1> one new ringer out of 10 </ARG1> , '' he adds .
One bright sign is that a <grow.01>growing</grow.01> <ARG1> number </ARG1> of women have entered the once male-dominated field ; more than a third of the ringers today are women .
<ARG1> They </ARG1> are <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <accept.01>accepted</accept.01> <ARGM-LOC> everywhere </ARGM-LOC> , <ARGM-DIS> however </ARGM-DIS> .
<ARG1> The oldest bell-ringing group in the country </ARG1> , the Ancient Society of College Youths , <found.01>founded</found.01> <ARGM-TMP> in 1637 </ARGM-TMP> , remains male-only , a fact that 's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain 's most prestigious churches , St. Paul 's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey .
This being Britain , <ARG0> no woman </ARG0> has <file.01>filed</file.01> <ARG1> an equal-opportunity suit </ARG1> , but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to `` The Ringing World , '' a weekly newspaper for ringers .
<ARG0> One writer </ARG0> , <sign.01>signing</sign.01> <ARG1> his letter </ARG1> <ARG2-as> as `` Red-blooded , balanced male </ARG2-as> , '' remarked on the `` frequency of women fainting in peals , '' and suggested that they `` settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings . ''
In <ARG1> the torrent of replies that </ARG1> <follow.01>followed</follow.01> , one woman ringer from Solihull observed that `` the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired : badly dressed , decorated with acne and a large beer-belly , frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals . ''
<ARG0> Another women </ARG0> <write.01>wrote</write.01> <ARGM-DIR> from Sheffield </ARGM-DIR> <ARGM-PNC> to say that in her 60 years of ringing , `` I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry </ARGM-PNC> .
<ARG0> I </ARG0> have <see.01>seen</see.01> <ARG1> one or two men die </ARG1> , bless them .
<ARG1> Investors </ARG1> <unsettle.01>unsettled</unsettle.01> <ARG0-by> by the stock market 's gyrations </ARG0-by> can take some comfort in the predictable arrival of quarterly dividend checks .
That has been particularly true this year with <ARG0> many companies </ARG0> <raise.01>raising</raise.01> <ARG1> their payouts </ARG1> <ARG2-EXT> more than 10 % </ARG2-EXT> .
<ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> do <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <breathe.01>breathe</breathe.01> <ARGM-MNR> too easy </ARGM-MNR> : Those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices , some analysts warn . </ARG0>
In the past , <ARG0> they </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> , the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stock-market party was almost over .
<ARG1> That can be a trap for unwary investors </ARG1> , <say.01>says</say.01> <ARG0> Richard Bernstein , senior quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co </ARG0> .
Strong dividend growth , <ARG0> he </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> , is `` the black widow of valuation '' -- a reference to the female spiders that attract males and then kill them after mating .
<ARG0> Stephen Boesel , president of T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund , </ARG0> <explain.01>explains</explain.01> <ARG1> that companies raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time </ARG1> .
`` <ARGM-ADV> Invariably </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> those strong periods in the economy </ARG0> <give.01>give</give.01> <ARG1> way </ARG1> <ARG2-to> to recessionary environments </ARG2-to> , '' he says .
<ARGM-DIS> Indeed </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> analysts </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> <ARG1> that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical peaks </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> In 1976 </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-DIS> , for example , </ARGM-DIS> <ARG1> dividends on the stocks in Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index </ARG1> <soar.01>soared</soar.01> <ARG2-EXT> 10 % </ARG2-EXT> , <ARGM-TMP> following much slower growth the year before </ARGM-TMP> .
The S&P index <start.01>started</start.01> sliding in price in September 1976 , and fell 12 % in 1977 -- despite a 15 % expansion in dividends that year .
<ARG1> That pattern </ARG1> has <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <ARGM-TMP> always </ARGM-TMP> <hold.03>held</hold.03> , but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious .
<ARG1> Payouts on the S&P 500 stocks </ARG1> <rise.01>rose</rise.01> <ARG2-EXT> 10 % </ARG2-EXT> <ARGM-TMP> in 1988 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-ADV> according to Standard & Poor 's Corp. </ARGM-ADV> , and Wall Street estimates for 1989 growth are generally between 9 % and 14 % .
<ARG0> Many people </ARG0> <believe.01>believe</believe.01> the growth in dividends will slow next year , <ARGM-ADV> although a minority see double-digit gains continuing </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARGM-TMP> Meanwhile </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> many market watchers </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> recent dividend trends raise another warning flag : While dividends have risen smartly , their expansion has n't kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices .
<ARGM-DIS> As a result </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG1> the market 's dividend yield -- dividends as a percentage of price -- </ARG1> has <slide.02>slid</slide.02> <ARG4-to> to a level that is fairly low and unenticing by historical standards </ARG4-to> .
<put.02><ARG1></put.02> <ARGM-MNR> another way </ARGM-MNR> , the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay , some market analysts say . </ARG1>
<ARG0> They </ARG0> are <keep.XX>keeping</keep.XX> <ARG1> a close watch on the yield on the S&P 500 </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Some analysts </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> investors should run for the exits if a sustained market rebound pushes the yield below 3 % .
A drop below that 3 % benchmark `` has always been a strong warning sign that <ARG1> stocks </ARG1> are <ARGM-MNR> fully </ARGM-MNR> <value.01>valued</value.01> , '' says Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price .
<ARGM-DIS> In fact </ARGM-DIS> , `` <ARG0> the market </ARG0> has <ARGM-TMP> always </ARGM-TMP> <tank.01>tanked</tank.01> .
There 's never been an exception , '' <say.01>says</say.01> <ARG0> Gerald W. Perritt , a Chicago investment adviser and money manager </ARG0> , <ARGM-MNR> based on a review of six decades of stock-market data </ARGM-MNR> .
The last time <ARG1> the S&P 500 yield </ARG1> <drop.01>dropped</drop.01> <ARG4-below> below 3 % </ARG4-below> was in the summer of 1987 .
<ARG0> Stockholders who </ARG0> <take.01>took</take.01> <ARG1> the hint </ARG1> and sold shares escaped the October debacle .
There have been only seven other times -- in 1929 , 1933 , 1961 , 1965 , 1968 , 1971 and 1972 -- when <ARG1> the yield on the S&P 500 </ARG1> <drop.01>dropped</drop.01> <ARG4-below> below 3 % </ARG4-below> <ARGM-TMP> for at least two consecutive months </ARGM-TMP> , Mr. Perritt found .
And in each case , <ARG0> he </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> , a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year .
<ARGM-DIS> Still </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> some market analysts </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> the current 3.3 % reading is n't as troublesome as it might have been in years past .
`` It 's <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> a very meaningful indicator currently because <ARG0> corporations </ARG0> are not <behave.01>behaving</behave.01> <ARG1-in> in a traditional manner </ARG1-in> , '' says James H. Coxon , head of stock investments for Cigna Corp. , the Philadelphia-based insurer .
In particular , <ARG0> Mr. Coxon </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> , businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically .
So , while <ARG0> stock prices </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> may </ARGM-MOD> <look.02>look</look.02> <ARG1> fairly high </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> relative to dividends </ARGM-ADV> , they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength .
Rather than <increase.01>increasing</increase.01> <ARG1> dividends </ARG1> , <ARG0> some companies </ARG0> have used cash to buy back some of their shares , notes Steven G. Einhorn , co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman , Sachs & Co .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <factor.01>factors</factor.01> <ARG1> that </ARG1> <ARG2-into> into the market yield </ARG2-into> <ARGM-PNC> to get an adjusted yield of about 3.6 % </ARGM-PNC> .
<ARG1> That is just a tad below the average of the past 40 years or so </ARG1> , <ARG0> he </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> .
<ARG1> What </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <happen.01>happen</happen.01> <ARG2-to> to dividend growth </ARG2-to> <ARGM-TMP> next year </ARGM-TMP> ?
<ARG0> Common wisdom </ARG0> <suggest.01>suggests</suggest.01> <ARG1> a single-digit rate of growth , reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits </ARG1> .
<ARG0> PaineWebber Inc. </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> , for instance , </ARGM-DIS> is <forecast.01>forecasting</forecast.01> <ARG1> growth in S&P 500 dividends of just under 5 % in 1990 , down from an estimated 11 % this year </ARG1> .
In other years in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns -- the environment <ARG0> the firm </ARG0> <expect.01>expects</expect.01> <ARGM-TMP> in 1990 </ARGM-TMP> -- the change in dividends ranged from a gain of 4 % to a decline of 1 % , according to PaineWebber analyst Thomas Doerflinger .
The minority argument , meanwhile , is that <ARG0> businesses </ARG0> <have.03>have</have.03> the financial wherewithal <ARGM-TMP> this time around </ARGM-TMP> to declare sharply higher dividends <ARGM-ADV> even if their earnings weaken </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG1> Dividend growth on the order of 12 % </ARG1> is <expect.01>expected</expect.01> <ARG0-by> by both Mr. Coxon of Cigna and Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs </ARG0-by> .
<ARG0> Those dividend bulls </ARG0> <argue.01>argue</argue.01> <ARG1> that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures </ARG1> .
One indicator <ARG0> investors </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> might </ARGM-MOD> <want.01>want</want.01> <ARG1> to watch </ARG1> is the monthly tally from Standard & Poor 's of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends .
A total of 139 companies <raise.01>raised</raise.01> <ARG1> dividends </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> in October </ARGM-TMP> , basically unchanged from 138 a year ago , S&P said Wednesday .
<ARG1> That </ARG1> <follow.01>followed</follow.01> <ARG2> four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year-earlier pace </ARG2> .
While <ARG2> the S&P tally </ARG2> does <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <measure.01>measure</measure.01> <ARG1> the magnitude of dividend changes </ARG1> , a further slippage in the number of dividend increases could be a harbinger of slower dividend growth next year .
<ARGM-DIS> In any case </ARGM-DIS> , opinion is <mix.01>mixed</mix.01> on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double-digit levels .
<ARG0> Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs </ARG0> <estimate.01>estimates</estimate.01> the stock market will deliver a 12 % to 15 % total return from appreciation and dividends over the next 12 months -- vs. a `` cash rate of return '' of perhaps 7 % or 8 % if dividend growth is weak .
But Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price , who <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <expect.01>expects</expect.01> <ARG1> 12 % growth in dividends next year </ARG1> , does n't think it will help the overall market all that much .
<ARG0> `` <have.03>Having</have.03> <ARG1> the dividend increases </ARG1> is a supportive element in the market outlook , but I do n't think it 's a main consideration , '' he says . </ARG0>
<ARGM-ADV> With slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year </ARGM-ADV> , `` <ARG0> I </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <look.01>look</look.01> <ARG1> for the market to have much upside from current levels </ARG1> .
Your Oct. 13 page-one story on the <renew.01>renewed</renew.01> <ARG1> plight </ARG1> of Western Union says that Western Union had lost its chance to be in the telephone business by turning down Alexander Graham Bell 's offer to it of his invention , because it supposedly felt that voice communication would never replace the telegraph .

<ARG0> Western Union </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> indeed </ARGM-DIS> <want.01>wanted</want.01> <ARG1> to get into the telephone business </ARG1> .

When <ARG0> Bell </ARG0> <establish.01>established</establish.01> <ARG1> that the Berliner patent caveat was registered 10 days before Edison 's application </ARG1> , Western Union dropped the lawsuit and agreed never to enter the telephone business -- the basis for the company 's current plight .

It was <ARG0> Richard Nixon 's first visit to China in 1972 that </ARG0> <set.02>set</set.02> <ARG2-in> in motion </ARG2-in> <ARG1> the historic rapprochement between Beijing and Washington </ARG1> .
But the former U.S. president 's sixth visit to China , during which <ARG0> he </ARG0> <speak.01>spoke</speak.01> <ARGM-TMP> at length </ARGM-TMP> <ARG2-with> with Chinese leaders </ARG2-with> , was nowhere near as successful at easing strains that have recently afflicted the Sino-U.S. relationship .
Mr. Nixon , the most prominent American to <come.01>come</come.01> <ARG4-to> to China </ARG4-to> <ARGM-TMP> since Beijing 's bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in June </ARGM-TMP> , harped on international outrage over the massacre .

<ARG0> The paper </ARG0> <accuse.01>accused</accuse.01> <ARG1> him </ARG1> of being a leading proponent of `` peaceful evolution , '' a catch phrase to describe what China believes is the policy of Western countries to seduce socialist nations into the capitalist sphere .
<ARG0> The tension was evident on Wednesday evening during Mr. Nixon 's final banquet toast , normally an opportunity for <recite.01>reciting</recite.01> <ARG1> platitudes about eternal friendship </ARG1> . </ARG0>
<ARGM-DIS> Instead </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> Mr. Nixon </ARG0> <remind.01>reminded</remind.01> <ARG2> his host , Chinese President Yang Shangkun , </ARG2> <ARG1> that Americans have n't forgiven China 's leaders for the military assault of June 3-4 that killed hundreds , and perhaps thousands , of demonstrators </ARG1> .
`` <ARG2> Many in the United States </ARG2> , <include.01>including</include.01> <ARG1> many friends of China </ARG1> , believe the crackdown was excessive and unjustified , '' Mr. Nixon told Mr. Yang , who was directly involved in ordering the attack .
`` <ARG0> The events of April through June </ARG0> <damage.01>damaged</damage.01> <ARG1> the respect and confidence which most Americans previously had for the leaders of China </ARG1> . ''
<ARG0> The Chinese </ARG0> <respond.01>responded</respond.01> <ARGM-MNR> in an equally undiplomatic fashion </ARGM-MNR> .
<ARGM-LOC> In talks with Mr. Nixon </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> Chinese leaders </ARG0> <express.01>expressed</express.01> <ARG1> no regret for the killings </ARG1> , and even suggested that the U.S. was prominently involved in the demonstrations this spring .
<ARGM-LOC> In a meeting </ARGM-LOC> <ARGM-TMP> Tuesday </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> supreme leader , Deng Xiaoping , </ARG0> <tell.01>told</tell.01> <ARG2> Mr. Nixon </ARG2> , `` <ARG1> Frankly speaking , the U.S. was involved too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion which occurred in Beijing not long ago </ARG1> .

<ARGM-ADV> Despite the harsh exchanges </ARGM-ADV> , the U.S. and China <ARGM-TMP> still </ARGM-TMP> <seem.01>seem</seem.01> to be looking for a way to mend relations , which have deteriorated into what Mr. Nixon referred to as `` the greatest crisis in Chinese-American relations '' since his initial visit to China 17 years ago .
<ARGM-LOC> In his return toast to Mr. Nixon </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> Mr. Yang </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the relationship had reached a `` stalemate . ''
Relations between China and the U.S. have been tense since June 7 , when <ARG0> Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife , Li Shuxian , </ARG0> <take.01>took</take.01> <ARG1> refuge </ARG1> <ARG2-in> in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing </ARG2-in> .
<ARGM-TMP> Shortly afterwards </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Mr. Bush </ARG0> <impose.01>imposed</impose.01> <ARG1> a series of anti-China sanctions , including suspension of most high-level talks , which could be codified in U.S. congressional legislation in the coming weeks </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Mr. Nixon </ARG0> is <travel.01>traveling</travel.01> <ARG1-in> in China </ARG1-in> <ARGM-MNR> as a private citizen </ARGM-MNR> , but he has made clear that he is an unofficial envoy for the Bush administration .
<ARG0> Mr. Nixon </ARG0> <meet.02>met</meet.02> <ARG1> Mr. Bush and his national security adviser , Brent Scowcroft , </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> before coming to China on Saturday </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARGM-DIS> And </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> he </ARG0> <plan.01>plans</plan.01> <ARG1> to brief the president at the end of the week </ARG1> , U.S. sources said .
<ARG0> Mr. Nixon </ARG0> was to <leave.01>leave</leave.01> <ARG1> China </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> today </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARGM-ADV> According to an American member of the Nixon party </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> the former president </ARG0> <raise.01>raised</raise.01> <ARG1> a number of controversial issues </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> in his 20 hours of talks with top-level Chinese officials </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG2> These </ARG2> <include.01>included</include.01> <ARG1> China 's economic policies , human rights and the question of Mr. Fang </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Mr. Nixon </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <propose.01>proposed</propose.01> <ARG1> that China restore its participation in the Fulbright Program , a U.S. government-funded academic exchange </ARG1> .
<ARG0> China </ARG0> <pull.02>pulled</pull.02> out <ARG1-of> of the program </ARG1-of> <ARGM-TMP> in July </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARGM-LOC> In his talks </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> the former president </ARG0> <urge.01>urged</urge.01> <ARG1> China 's leaders </ARG1> <ARG2> to acknowledge that their nation is part of the world community and welcome the infusion of outside contacts and ideas </ARG2> .
`` <ARG1> Ideas </ARG1> are <go.01>going</go.01> <ARG4-over> over borders </ARG4-over> , and there 's no SDI ideological weapon that can shoot them down , '' he told a group of Americans at the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday .
But <ARGM-LOC> in one minor matter </ARGM-LOC> , Mr. Nixon <appear.02>appears</appear.02> to have gained a concession .
<ARGM-LOC> In a meeting with Premier Li Peng on Monday </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> Mr. Nixon </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> that he hoped he would n't encounter guards with machine guns during his visit to the U.S. Embassy .
Sure enough , when <ARG1> he </ARG1> <arrive.01>arrived</arrive.01> <ARG4-at> at the embassy </ARG4-at> <ARGM-TMP> two days later </ARGM-TMP> , the machine-gun-toting guards were gone -- for the first time in five months .
A few blocks away , at the U.S. ambassador 's residence , <ARG1> the guards </ARG1> <encircle.01>encircling</encircle.01> <ARG2> the compound </ARG2> also had discarded their Uzi-model arms for the first time since early June .
But <ARG0> the guards there </ARG0> <retain.01>retained</retain.01> <ARG1> their pistols </ARG1> , and a large contingent of plainclothes police remained nearby in unmarked cars .
<ARGM-ADV> Moreover </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> police and soldiers </ARG0> <continue.01>continue</continue.01> <ARG1> to harass Americans , who have filed several protests with the Foreign Ministry in the past week </ARG1> .

<ARG0> Program traders </ARG0> are fond of <predict.01>predicting</predict.01> <ARG1> that if they are blocked in the U.S. , they will simply emigrate to foreign stock markets </ARG1> .
But in London and Tokyo , where <ARG0> computer-driven trading </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> now </ARGM-TMP> <play.02>plays</play.02> <ARG1> a small but growing role </ARG1> , traders say a number of hurdles loom .
<ARG0> Government officials </ARG0> <ARGM-LOC> , especially in Japan , </ARGM-LOC> <ARGM-ADV> probably </ARGM-ADV> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <resist.01>resist</resist.01> <ARG1> any onslaught of program trading by players trying to shrug off the U.S. furor over their activities and marching abroad with their business </ARG1> .
<ARG1> Japan </ARG1> is `` <ARGM-ADV> very </ARGM-ADV> <concern.01>concerned</concern.01> '' <ARG0-about> about the possible effects of program trading </ARG0-about> , a senior Japanese official said after the Oct. 13 stock plunge in New York .
<ARG1> U.S. stock-index futures </ARG1> are <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <ARGM-DIS> even </ARGM-DIS> <trade.01>traded</trade.01> <ARGM-LOC> in Japan </ARGM-LOC> <ARGM-TMP> now </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARGM-DIS> And </ARGM-DIS> <ARGM-CAU> because of the time difference </ARGM-CAU> , <ARG0> the Japanese and the U.S. markets ' trading hours </ARG0> do <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <overlap.01>overlap</overlap.01> .
<ARG1> It all </ARG1> <add.04>adds</add.04> up <ARG2-to> to a barrier to American-style index arbitrage , the most popular form of U.S. program trading that seeks to exploit brief differences between prices of stocks in New York and the price of a futures contract in Chicago based on those stocks </ARG2-to> .
<ARG1> About 11.6 % of all program trading by New York Stock Exchange firms in September </ARG1> <take.14>took</take.14> <ARG2> place </ARG2> <ARGM-LOC> in foreign markets </ARGM-LOC> , <ARGM-ADV> according to Big Board data </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> Yet it is difficult to <imagine.01>imagine</imagine.01> <ARG1> Japan racing to introduce Chicago-style stock-index futures </ARG1> . </ARG0>
<ARG0> Japan 's Finance Ministry </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> already </ARGM-TMP> is <scrutinize.01>scrutinizing</scrutinize.01> <ARG1> institutional investors ' activity </ARG1> <ARGM-PNC> to see whether policy changes are needed to cope with the current level of program trading </ARGM-PNC> , said Makato Utsumi , vice minister for international finance .
<ARG1> Program trading </ARG1> has <take.08>taken</take.08> off <ARGM-LOC> in Japan </ARGM-LOC> <ARGM-TMP> since last year 's introduction of home-market stock-index futures trading on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> have <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <forget.01>forgotten</forget.01> the leap in share prices last Dec. 7 , when the first bout of foreign-led index arbitrage drove stocks skyward in the last half-hour of trading , startling regulators who thought they had written enough rules to prevent such a swing .
<ARG0> Japan 's Finance Ministry </ARG0> had <set.03>set</set.03> up mechanisms to limit how far futures prices could fall in a single session and to give market operators the authority to suspend trading in futures at any time .
`` <ARG1> Maybe it was n't enough </ARG1> , '' <ARG0> a Finance Ministry official </ARG0> <note.XX>noted</note.XX> <ARGM-TMP> after the Dec. 7 surge </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> Japan 's regulators </ARG0> have <ARGM-TMP> since </ARGM-TMP> <tighten.01>tightened</tighten.01> <ARG1> controls on index-related stock purchases </ARG1> .
Tokyo 's <lead.01>leading</lead.01> <ARG0> program traders </ARG0> are the big U.S. securities houses , though the Japanese are playing catch-up .
<ARG0> Some U.S. firms , notably Salomon Inc. and Morgan Stanley Group Inc. , </ARG0> have <reap.01>reaped</reap.01> <ARG1> a hefty chunk of their Japanese earnings </ARG1> <ARG2-from> from index arbitrage , both for customers and for their own accounts </ARG2-from> .
-LRB- <ARG0> Morgan Stanley </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> last week </ARGM-TMP> <join.01>joined</join.01> <ARG1> a growing list of U.S. securities firms that have stopped doing index arbitrage for their own accounts </ARG1> . -RRB-
Both Deryck C. Maughan , who <head.01>heads</head.01> <ARG1> Salomon </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> in Tokyo </ARGM-LOC> , and John S. Wadsworth , who heads Morgan Stanley there , ascribe a good part of their firms ' success in Tokyo to their ability to offer sophisticated , futures-related investment strategies to big institutional clients .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> do <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <have.03>have</have.03> <ARG1> plans to cut back </ARG1> .
`` <ARG1> It has not been disruptive in the markets here </ARG1> , '' <ARG0> Mr. Maughan </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> .
`` The real difference <seem.01>seems</seem.01> to be that the cash market here ... is big enough and liquid enough that the futures market is n't having the same impact it does in America . ''
<ARG0> The British </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> are <scrutinize.01>scrutinizing</scrutinize.01> <ARG1> program trades </ARG1> .
Index-arbitrage trading is `` something <ARG0> we </ARG0> <want.01>want</want.01> <ARG1> to watch closely </ARG1> , '' an official at London 's Stock Exchange said .
`` <ARG0> We </ARG0> do <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <think.01>think</think.01> there is cause for concern at the moment . ''
<ARG0> London </ARG0> <serve.01>serves</serve.01> <ARGM-MNR> increasingly </ARGM-MNR> <ARG1-as> as a conduit for program trading of U.S. stocks </ARG1-as> .
<ARG0> Market professionals </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> London has several attractions .
<ARGM-ADV> First </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG1> the trading </ARG1> is <do.02>done</do.02> <ARGM-MNR> over the counter </ARGM-MNR> and is n't reported on either the U.S. or London stock trading tapes .
<ARGM-DIS> Second </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG1> it </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> be <use.01>used</use.01> <ARG2-PNC> to unwind positions before U.S. trading begins , but at prices pegged to the previous session 's Big Board close </ARG2-PNC> .
<ARG0> In addition to the extra privacy of these trades , <ARG1> the transactions </ARG1> can often be less expensive to <execute.02>execute</execute.02> , because the parties do n't have to pay a floor brokerage fee or a specialist 's fee . </ARG0>
<ARGM-DIS> Still </ARGM-DIS> , `` <ARG1> Much less -LCB- index-arbitrage activity -RCB- </ARG1> is <do.02>done</do.02> <ARGM-LOC> over here than in the U.S. </ARGM-LOC> '' said Richard Barfield , chief investment manager at Standard Life Assurance Co. , which manages about # 15 billion -LRB- $ 23.72 billion -RRB- in United Kingdom institutional funds .
<ARG0> Britain </ARG0> <have.03>has</have.03> <ARG1> two main index-arbitrage instruments </ARG1> .
<ARG1> A Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index option contract </ARG1> is <trade.01>traded</trade.01> <ARGM-LOC> on the London Stock Exchange 's Traded Options Market </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARGM-DIS> And </ARGM-DIS> <ARG1> an FT-SE futures contract </ARG1> is <trade.01>traded</trade.01> <ARGM-LOC> on the London International Financial Futures Exchange </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG0> Both contracts </ARG0> have <gain.02>gained</gain.02> <ARG1> a following </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> since the 1987 global market crash </ARGM-TMP> .
The average number of <ARG1> FT-SE option contracts </ARG1> <trade.01>traded</trade.01> <ARGM-LOC> on the London exchange </ARGM-LOC> has surged nearly tenfold since the contract 's launch in 1984 .
This year , the average of <ARG1> daily contracts </ARG1> <trade.01>traded</trade.01> totaled 9,118 , up from 4,645 a year earlier and from 917 in 1984 .
But <ARG0> a survey </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> early this summer </ARGM-TMP> <indicate.01>indicated</indicate.01> <ARG1> that the volume of index-options trading was only 15 % of the size of the underlying equity market </ARG1> , exchange officials said .
<ARG1> This </ARG1> <compare.01>compares</compare.01> <ARG2-with> with estimates that the U.S. `` derivatives '' market is perhaps four times as large as the underlying domestic market </ARG2-with> .
<ARG0> The House </ARG0> <vote.01>voted</vote.01> <ARG1> to boost the federal minimum wage </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> for the first time since early 1981 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-ADV> casting a solid 382-37 vote for a compromise measure backed by President Bush </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG1> The vote </ARG1> <come.01>came</come.01> <ARGM-TMP> after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> Advocates </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the 90-cent-an-hour rise , to $ 4.25 an hour by April 1991 , is too small for the working poor , <ARGM-ADV> while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG2> the legislation </ARG2> <reflect.01>reflected</reflect.01> <ARG1> a compromise agreed to on Tuesday by President Bush and Democratic leaders in Congress , after congressional Republicans urged the White House to bend a bit from its previous resistance to compromise </ARG1> .
So <ARG0> both sides </ARG0> <accept.01>accepted</accept.01> <ARG1> the compromise , which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four-year law was enacted in 1977 , raising the wage to $ 3.35 an hour from $ 2.65 </ARG1> .
Under <ARG1> the measure </ARG1> <pass.01>passed</pass.01> <ARGM-TMP> yesterday </ARGM-TMP> , the minimum wage would rise to $ 3.80 next April .
<ARG0> The Senate </ARG0> <plan.01>plans</plan.01> <ARG1> to take up the measure quickly </ARG1> and is expected to pass it .
`` <ARG1> There are no smiles about this bill </ARG1> , '' <ARG0> Rep. Pat Williams -LRB- D. , Mont . -RRB- </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARGM-TMP> during House floor debate </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-TMP> yesterday </ARGM-TMP> .
But `` because it 's all <ARG0> we </ARG0> 've <get.02>got</get.02> , I 'm going to vote for it . ''
While <ARG1> the minimum wage </ARG1> had <ARGM-TMP> traditionally </ARGM-TMP> been <peg.01>pegged</peg.01> <ARG2-at> at half the average U.S. manufacturing wage </ARG2-at> , the level of $ 4.25 an hour in 1991 will still be less than 35 % of average factory pay , Mr. Williams said .
But <ARG0> Rep. Marge Roukema -LRB- R. , N.J . -RRB- </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> instead </ARGM-DIS> <praise.01>praised</praise.01> <ARG1> the House 's acceptance of a new youth `` training '' wage , a subminimum that GOP administrations have sought for many years </ARG1> .
<adopt.01><ARG0></adopt.01> <ARG1> a training-wage policy </ARG1> means `` getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage , '' Mrs. Roukema said . </ARG0>
<ARG0> Policy makers </ARG0> <regard.01>regard</regard.01> <ARG1> the youth wage </ARG1> <ARG2-as> as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage </ARG2-as> , but they have lately touted it as necessary to help impart job skills to entrants into the work force .
<ARG0> Labor unions and Democrats </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> long </ARGM-TMP> <fight.01>fought</fight.01> <ARG1> the idea </ARG1> , but recently acceded to it in the face of Bush administration insistence .
<ARG0> The compromise </ARG0> <set.01>sets</set.01> <ARG1> the training wage </ARG1> at $ 3.35 an hour next April , and <ARG2-at> at $ 3.61 an hour , or 85 % of the minimum wage , in April 1991 </ARG2-at> .
<ARG0> Employers </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <pay.01>pay</pay.01> <ARG1> the subminimum </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> for 90 days </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-MNR> without restriction </ARGM-MNR> , <ARG2-to> to workers with less than six months of job experience </ARG2-to> , and for another 90 days if the company uses a government-certified training program for the young workers .
<ARG2> The training wage </ARG2> <cover.01>covers</cover.01> <ARGM-ADV> only </ARGM-ADV> <ARG1> workers who are 16 to 19 years old </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The White House </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> previously </ARGM-TMP> <insist.01>insisted</insist.01> on an unrestricted six-month training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job .
<ARG0> The U.S. Chamber of Commerce </ARG0> , <ARGM-TMP> still </ARGM-TMP> <oppose.01>opposed</oppose.01> <ARG1-to> to any mininum-wage increase </ARG1-to> , said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor 27 % in two stages between April 1990 and April 1991 `` will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for American workers and higher prices for American consumers .

<ARGM-TMP> For six years </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> T. Marshall Hahn Jr. </ARG0> has <make.01>made</make.01> <ARG1> corporate acquisitions </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> in the George Bush mode : kind and gentle </ARGM-MNR> .
The question now : <ARGM-MOD> Can </ARGM-MOD> <ARG0> he </ARG0> <act.01>act</act.01> <ARGM-ADV> more </ARGM-ADV> like <ARG1-like> hard-charging Teddy Roosevelt </ARG1-like> ?
<ARG0> Mr. Hahn , the 62-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of Georgia-Pacific Corp. </ARG0> is <lead.01>leading</lead.01> <ARG1> the forest-product concern 's unsolicited $ 3.19 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Nekoosa </ARG0> has <give.01>given</give.01> <ARG2> the offer </ARG2> a public cold shoulder , a reaction Mr. Hahn has n't faced in his 18 earlier acquisitions , all of which were negotiated behind the scenes .
<ARGM-TMP> So far </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Mr. Hahn </ARG0> is <try.01>trying</try.01> <ARG1> to entice Nekoosa into negotiating a friendly surrender </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> while talking tough </ARGM-ADV> .
`` <ARG1> We </ARG1> are <prepare.02>prepared</prepare.02> <ARG2> to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction </ARG2> , '' he says .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> a takeover battle </ARG0> <open.03>opens</open.03> up the possibility of a bidding war , with all that implies .
If <ARG0> a competitor </ARG0> <enter.01>enters</enter.01> <ARG1> the game </ARG1> , for example , Mr. Hahn could face the dilemma of paying a premium for Nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival .
<give.01>Given</give.01> <ARG1> that choice </ARG1> , <ARG2> associates of Mr. Hahn and industry observers </ARG2> say the former university president -- who has developed a reputation for not overpaying for anything -- would fold .
`` There 's a price above which I 'm positive <ARG0> Marshall </ARG0> <have.03>has</have.03> the courage not to pay , '' says A.D. Correll , Georgia-Pacific 's executive vice president for pulp and paper .
<say.01>Says</say.01> <ARG0> long-time associate Jerry Griffin , vice president , corporate development , at WTD Industries Inc. </ARG0> : `` <ARG1> He is n't of the old school of winning at any cost </ARG1> . ''
<ARG1> He also is a consensus manager </ARG1> , <ARG0> insiders </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> .
<ARG0> The decision to <make.03>make</make.03> <ARG1> the bid for Nekoosa </ARG1> , for example , was made only after all six members of Georgia-Pacific 's management committee signed onto the deal -- even though Mr. Hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on , says Mr. Correll . </ARG0>
<ARG0> Associates </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> Mr. Hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute .
<assume.01>Assuming</assume.01> <ARG1> that post </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> at the age of 35 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> he </ARG0> managed by consensus , as is the rule in universities , says Warren H. Strother , a university official who is researching a book on Mr. Hahn .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> he </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <show.01>showed</show.01> <ARG1> a willingness to take a strong stand </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> In 1970 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Mr. Hahn </ARG0> <call.02>called</call.02> in <ARG1> state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building </ARG1> .
<ARG0> That </ARG0> <impress.01>impressed</impress.01> <ARG1> Robert B. Pamplin , Georgia-Pacific 's chief executive at the time , whom Mr. Hahn had met while fundraising for the institute </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> In 1975 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Mr. Pamplin </ARG0> <entice.01>enticed</entice.01> <ARG1> Mr. Hahn </ARG1> <ARG2-into> into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals </ARG2-into> ; the move befuddled many in Georgia-Pacific who did n't believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG1> Mr. Hahn </ARG1> <rise.01>rose</rise.01> <ARGM-MNR> swiftly </ARGM-MNR> <ARGM-MNR> through the ranks </ARGM-MNR> , demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says he knew he possessed early on .
The son of a physicist , Mr. Hahn <skip.01>skipped</skip.01> <ARG1> first grade </ARG1> <ARGM-PNC> because his reading ability was so far above his classmates </ARGM-PNC> .
<move.01>Moving</move.01> <ARGM-MNR> rapidly </ARGM-MNR> <ARGM-DIR> through school </ARGM-DIR> , <ARG1> he </ARG1> graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Kentucky at age 18 , after spending only 2 1\/2 years in college .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <earn.01>earned</earn.01> <ARG1> his doctorate in nuclear physics </ARG1> <ARG3-from> from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology </ARG3-from> .
<ARG0> Mr. Hahn </ARG0> <agree.01>agrees</agree.01> <ARG1> that he has a `` retentive '' memory </ARG1> , but friends say that 's an understatement .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <call.01>call</call.01> <ARG1> it </ARG1> <ARG2> `` photographic '' </ARG2> .
<ARG0> Mr. Hahn </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> has <engineer.01>engineered</engineer.01> <ARG1> a surprising turnaround of Georgia-Pacific </ARG1> .
<take.12>Taking</take.12> over as <ARG1-as> chief executive officer </ARG1-as> <ARGM-TMP> in 1983 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> he </ARG0> inherited a company that was mired in debt and hurt by a recession-inspired slide in its building-products business .
<ARG0> Mr. Hahn </ARG0> <begin.01>began</begin.01> <ARG1> selling non-core businesses , such as oil and gas and chemicals </ARG1> .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> even </ARGM-ADV> <sell.01>sold</sell.01> <ARG1> one unit that made vinyl checkbook covers </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> At the same time </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> he </ARG0> <begin.01>began</begin.01> <ARG1> building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while refocusing building products on home repair and remodeling , rather than materials for new-home construction </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The idea was to <buffet.01>buffet</buffet.01> <ARG1> building products </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> from cycles in new-home construction </ARGM-LOC> . </ARG0>
<ARG1> The formula </ARG1> has <pay.05>paid</pay.05> off , <ARGM-TMP> so far </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG1> Georgia-Pacific 's sales </ARG1> <climb.02>climbed</climb.02> <ARG4-to> to $ 9.5 billion </ARG4-to> <ARGM-TMP> last year </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-ADV> compared with $ 6 billion in 1983 , when Mr. Hahn took the reins </ARGM-ADV> .
Profit from <continue.01>continuing</continue.01> <ARG1> operations </ARG1> has soared to $ 467 million from $ 75 million .
<ARG0> Mr. Hahn </ARG0> <attribute.01>attributes</attribute.01> <ARG1> the gains </ARG1> <ARG2-to> to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows best </ARG2-to> .
`` The record of <ARG0> companies that </ARG0> have <diversify.01>diversified</diversify.01> is n't all that impressive , '' he says .
It would be a good match , <ARG0> Mr. Hahn and many analysts </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> , of two healthy companies with high-quality assets and strong cash flows .
The <result.01>resulting</result.01> <ARG2> company </ARG2> would be the largest forest-products concern in the world with combined sales of more than $ 13 billion .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <ARG0> Mr. Hahn </ARG0> <carry.05>carry</carry.05> <ARG1> it </ARG1> off ?
In this instance , <ARG0> industry observers </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> , he is entering uncharted waters .
<say.01>Says</say.01> <ARG0> Kathryn McAuley , an analyst at First Manhattan Co. </ARG0> : `` This is the greatest acquisition challenge he has faced .
<ARG0> A House-Senate conference </ARG0> <approve.01>approved</approve.01> <ARG1> major portions of a package for more than $ 500 million in economic aid for Poland that relies heavily on $ 240 million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 </ARG1> <ARGM-PNC> in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment </ARGM-PNC> .
<ARGM-PNC> For the Agency for International Development </ARGM-PNC> , <ARG0> appropriators </ARG0> <approve.01>approved</approve.01> <ARG1> $ 200 million in secondary loan guarantees </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> under an expanded trade credit insurance program </ARGM-LOC> , and total loan guarantees for the Overseas Private Investment Corp. are increased by $ 40 million over fiscal 1989 as part of the same Poland package .
<ARG0> The conference </ARG0> <approve.01>approved</approve.01> <ARG1> at least $ 55 million in direct cash and development assistance </ARG1> <ARGM-DIS> as well </ARGM-DIS> , and though no decision was made , both sides are committed to adding more than $ 200 million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the Bush administration .
<ARG1> The agreement on Poland </ARG1> <contrast.01>contrasts</contrast.01> <ARG2-with> with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill , which has already provoked veto threats by the White House and is sharply confined under this year 's budget </ARG2-with> .
<ARG0> These fiscal pressures </ARG0> are also a factor in <shape.01>shaping</shape.01> <ARG1> the Poland package </ARG1> , and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending , the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on U.S. aid to Eastern Europe .
To <accommodate.01>accommodate</accommodate.01> <ARG1> the additional cash assistance </ARG1> , <ARG0> the House Appropriations Committee </ARG0> last week was required to reallocate an estimated $ 140 million from the Pentagon .
And though the size of <ARG1> the loan guarantees </ARG1> <approve.01>approved</approve.01> <ARGM-TMP> yesterday </ARGM-TMP> is significant , recent experience with a similar program in Central America indicates that it could take several years before the new Polish government can fully use the aid effectively .
<ARG1> The action on Poland </ARG1> <come.04>came</come.04> <ARGM-TMP> as the conference separately approved $ 220 million for international population planning activities , an 11 % increase over fiscal 1989 </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG1> The House and Senate </ARG1> are <divide.02>divided</divide.02> <ARGM-PNC> over whether the United Nations Population Fund will receive any portion of these appropriations </ARGM-PNC> , but the size of the increase is itself significant .
<ARGM-LOC> In a second area of common concern , the world environment , </ARGM-LOC> <ARG1> an additional $ 15 million </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> be <provide.01>provided</provide.01> in development assistance to fund a series of initiatives , related both to global warming and the plight of the African elephant .
<ARG0> The sweeping nature of the bill </ARG0> <draw.02>draws</draw.02> <ARG1> a variety of special interest amendments , running from an import exemption for a California airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of Panama 's quota of exports to the profitable U.S. market </ARG1> .
<ARG2> Panama </ARG2> was <strip.01>stripped</strip.01> <ARG1-of> of this right </ARG1-of> <ARGM-CAU> because of U.S. differences with the Noriega regime </ARGM-CAU> , but the Central American country would have received a quota of 30,537 metric tons over a 21-month period ending Sept. 30 , 1990 .
<ARG1> About a quarter of this share </ARG1> has <ARGM-TMP> already </ARGM-TMP> been <reallocate.01>reallocated</reallocate.01> , <ARGM-ADV> according to the industry </ARGM-ADV> , but the remaining 23,403 tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current U.S. price of 18 cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate .
The potential sales are nearly $ 9.3 million , and <ARG0> House Majority Whip William Gray -LRB- D. , Pa . -RRB- </ARG0> <begin.01>began</begin.01> <ARG1> the bidding </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> this year </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-MNR> by proposing language that the quota be allocated to English-speaking countries of the Caribbean , such as Jamaica and Barbados </ARGM-MNR> .
<ARG0> Rep. Jerry Lewis , a conservative Californian , </ARG0> <add.02>added</add.02> <ARG1> a provision of his own intended to assist Bolivia </ARG1> , and the Senate then broadened the list further by including all countries in the U.S. Caribbean Basin initiate as well as the Philippines - backed by the powerful Hawaii Democrat Sen. Daniel Inouye .
<ARG0> Jamaica </ARG0> , wary of <upset.01>upsetting</upset.01> <ARG1> its Caribbean Basin allies </ARG1> , has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by Mr. Gray , but the greater question is whether Mr. Inouye , who has strong ties to the sugar industry , is able to insert a claim by the Philippines .
<ARGM-LOC> In separate floor action </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> the House </ARG0> <waive.01>waived</waive.01> <ARG1> budget restrictions </ARG1> and gave quick approval to $ 3.18 billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs in fiscal 1990 .
<ARG1> The funding </ARG1> is <attach.01>attached</attach.01> <ARG1-to> to an estimated $ 27.1 billion transportation bill that goes next to the Senate and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all U.S. domestic airline flights </ARG1-to> .
<ARG0> The leadership </ARG0> <hope.01>hopes</hope.01> <ARG1> to move the compromise measure promptly to the White House </ARG1> , but in recent days , the Senate has been as likely to bounce bills back to the House .
The most recent example was <ARG2> a nearly $ 17.3 billion fiscal 1990 bill </ARG2> <fund.01>funding</fund.01> <ARG1> the State , Justice and Commerce departments </ARG1> .
And after <lose.03>losing</lose.03> <ARG1> a battle </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> Tuesday night </ARGM-TMP> <ARG2-with> with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee </ARG2-with> , <ARG0> appropriators from both houses </ARG0> are expected to be forced back to conference .
<ARG0> Beauty </ARG0> <take.01>Takes</take.01> <ARG1> Backseat </ARG1> <ARG2-To> To Safety </ARG2-To> <ARGM-LOC> on Bridges </ARGM-LOC>
<ARG0> EVERYONE </ARG0> <agree.01>AGREES</agree.01> <ARG1> that most of the nation 's old bridges need to be repaired or replaced </ARG1> .
<ARG0> But there 's disagreement over <ARGM-MNR> how </ARGM-MNR> to <do.02>do</do.02> <ARG1> it </ARG1> . </ARG0>
<ARG0> Highway officials </ARG0> <insist.01>insist</insist.01> the ornamental railings on older bridges are n't strong enough to prevent vehicles from crashing through .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> other people </ARG0> do <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <want.01>want</want.01> <ARG1> to lose the bridges ' beautiful , sometimes historic , features </ARG1> .
`` The primary purpose of <ARG0> a railing </ARG0> is to <contain.01>contain</contain.01> <ARG1> a vehicle </ARG1> and not to provide a scenic view , '' says Jack White , a planner with the Indiana Highway Department .
<ARG0> He and others </ARG0> <prefer.01>prefer</prefer.01> <ARG1> to install railings such as the `` type F safety shape , '' a four-foot-high concrete slab with no openings </ARG1> .
<ARGM-LOC> In Richmond , Ind. , </ARGM-LOC> <ARG1> the type F railing </ARG1> is being <use.01>used</use.01> <ARG2-PNC> to replace arched openings on the G Street Bridge </ARG2-PNC> .
Garret Boone , who <teach.01>teaches</teach.01> <ARG1> art </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> at Earlham College </ARGM-LOC> , calls the new structure `` just an ugly bridge '' and one that blocks the view of a new park below .
<ARGM-LOC> In Hartford , Conn. </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG1> the Charter Oak Bridge </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-TMP> soon </ARGM-TMP> be <replace.01>replaced</replace.01> , <ARGM-ADV> the cast-iron medallions from its railings relegated to a park </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG1> Citizens in Peninsula , Ohio </ARG1> , <upset.01>upset</upset.01> <ARG0-over> over changes to a bridge </ARG0-over> , negotiated a deal : The bottom half of the railing will be type F , while the top half will have the old bridge 's floral pattern .
<ARGM-ADV> Similarly </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> highway engineers </ARG0> <agree.01>agreed</agree.01> <ARG1> to keep the old railings on the Key Bridge in Washington , D.C. , as long as they could install a crash barrier between the sidewalk and the road </ARG1> .

<ARG1> Seed for Jail Solution </ARG1> <fail.01>Fails</fail.01> <ARG2> to Take Root </ARG2>
IT 'S A TWO BIRDS with one stone deal : <ARG0> Eggers Group architects </ARG0> <propose.01>propose</propose.01> <ARG1> using grain elevators to house prisoners </ARG1> .

But New York state , which is <seek.01>seeking</seek.01> <ARG1> solutions to its prison cell shortage </ARG1> , says `` no . ''
<ARG1> Grain elevators </ARG1> <build.01>built</build.01> <ARGM-TMP> in the 1920s and '30s </ARGM-TMP> have six-inch concrete walls and a tubular shape that would easily contain semicircular cells with a control point in the middle , the New York firm says .
<ARG0> Many </ARG0> are far enough from residential areas to <pass.08>pass</pass.08> <ARG1> public muster </ARG1> , yet close enough to permit family visits .
Besides , <ARG0> Eggers </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> , grain elevators are worth preserving for aesthetic reasons -- one famed architect compared them to the pyramids of Egypt .
<ARG2> A number of cities </ARG2> -- <include.01>including</include.01> <ARG1> Minneapolis , Philadelphia and Houston </ARG1> -- have vacant grain elevators , Eggers says .
A medium-sized one in Brooklyn , <ARG0> it </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> , could be altered to house up to 1,000 inmates at a lower cost than building a new prison in upstate New York .
<ARG0> A spokesman for the state </ARG0> , <ARGM-DIS> however </ARGM-DIS> , <call.01>calls</call.01> <ARG1> the idea </ARG1> <ARG2> `` not effective or cost efficient </ARG2> .

<ARG2> A second citation </ARG2> <cover.01>covering</cover.01> <ARG1> the company 's Clairton , Pa. , coke works </ARG1> involved more than 200 alleged violations of electrical-safety and other requirements , for which OSHA proposed $ 1.2 million in fines .
<ARG0> Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> , `` <ARG1> The magnitude of these penalties and citations is matched only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from corporate indifference to worker safety and health , and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards </ARG1> . ''
<ARG0> OSHA </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> there have been three worker fatalities at the two plants in the past two years and 17 deaths since 1972 .
<ARG0> Gerard Scannell , the head of OSHA , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> USX managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years , `` yet have failed to take necessary action to counteract the hazards . ''
`` Particularly flagrant , '' <ARG0> Mrs. Dole </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> , `` are the company 's numerous failures to properly record injuries at its Fairless works , in spite of the firm promise it had made in an earlier corporate-wide settlement agreement to correct such discrepancies . ''
<ARG0> A USX spokesman </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the company had n't yet received any documents from OSHA regarding the penalty or fine .
`` <ARGM-TMP> Once we do </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> they </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <receive.01>receive</receive.01> <ARG1> very serious evaluation </ARG1> , '' the spokesman said .
<ARG0> USX </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it has been cooperating with OSHA since the agency began investigating the Clairton and Fairless works .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that , if and when safety problems were identified , they were corrected </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The USX citations </ARG0> <represent.01>represented</represent.01> <ARG1> the first sizable enforcement action taken by OSHA under Mr. Scannell </ARG1> .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> has <promise.01>promised</promise.01> <ARG2> stiffer fines </ARG2> , <ARGM-ADV> though the size of penalties sought by OSHA have been rising in recent years even before he took office this year </ARGM-ADV> .
`` The big problem is that USX management has <prove.01>proved</prove.01> unwilling to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to safeguarding safety and health in the plants , '' said Linda Anku , OSHA regional administrator in Philadelphia .
<ARG0> USX </ARG0> <have.03>has</have.03> 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed penalties , before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission .
Before the USX case , OSHA 's largest <propose.01>proposed</propose.01> <ARG1> fine </ARG1> for one employer was $ 4.3 million for alleged safety violations at John Morrell & Co. , a meatpacking subsidiary of United Brands Co. , Cincinnati .
<ARG0> The company </ARG0> is <contest.01>contesting</contest.01> <ARG1> the fine </ARG1> .
<ARGM-CAU> Due to an editing error </ARGM-CAU> , <ARG0> a letter to the editor in yesterday 's edition from Frederick H. Hallett </ARG0> <ARGM-MNR> mistakenly </ARGM-MNR> <identify.01>identified</identify.01> <ARG1> the NRDC </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Your comments </ARG0> <imply.01>implied</imply.01> we had discovered that the `` principal cause '' of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population .
<ARG0> We </ARG0> have <make.01>made</make.01> <ARG1> no such statement </ARG1> .
It is clear that <ARG1> most mentally ill people and most alcoholics </ARG1> do <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> <become.01>become</become.01> <ARG2> homeless </ARG2> .
<ARG1> The `` causes '' of homelessness </ARG1> are <ARGM-MNR> poorly </ARGM-MNR> <understand.01>understood</understand.01> and complex in any individual case .
In <quote.01>quoting</quote.01> <ARG1-from> from our research </ARG1-from> <ARG0> you </ARG0> emphasized the high prevalance of mental illness and alcoholism .
<ARG0> You </ARG0> did <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> <note.XX>note</note.XX> that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <suffer.01>suffered</suffer.01> <ARG1-from> from malnutrition , chest diseases , cardiovascular disorders , skin problems , infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape </ARG1-from> .
<ARG0> Homeless people </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> not only </ARGM-DIS> <lack.01>lack</lack.01> <ARG1> safety , privacy and shelter </ARG1> , they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition , cleanliness and basic health care .
<ARGM-LOC> In a recent report </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> the Institute of Medicine </ARG0> <point.02>pointed</point.02> out <ARG1> that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness , others may be a consequence of it , and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The interactions between health and homelessness </ARG0> are complex , <defy.01>defying</defy.01> <ARG1> sweeping generalizations as to `` cause '' or `` effect </ARG1> . ''
If <ARG0> we </ARG0> <look.01>look</look.01> <ARG1-to> to the future </ARG1-to> , preventing homelessness is an important objective .
<ARG0> This </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <require.01>require</require.01> <ARG2> us </ARG2> <ARG1> to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess , an understanding that can be developed only through careful study and research </ARG1> .
<ARG0> A study by Tulane Prof. James Wright </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> homelessness is due to a complex array of problems , with the common thread of poverty .
<ARG0> The study </ARG0> <show.01>shows</show.01> <ARG1> that nearly 40 % of the homeless population is made up of women and children and that only 25 % of the homeless exhibits some combination of drug , alcohol and mental problems </ARG1> .
According to Dr. Wright , homelessness is `` simultaneously a housing problem , an employment problem , a demographic problem , <ARG1> a problem </ARG1> of social disaffiliation , a mental health problem , a family violence problem , a problem <create.01>created</create.01> <ARG0-by> by the cutbacks in social welfare spending </ARG0-by> , a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family , and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level . ''
<ARG0> To <quote.01>quote</quote.01> <ARG1> the highly regarded director of a privately funded drop-in center for the homeless in New York </ARG1> : `` <ARG2> If you 're homeless , you do n't sleep for fear of being robbed or murdered </ARG2> . </ARG0>
After your first three weeks of sleep deprivation , <ARG0> you </ARG0> 're scarcely in touch with reality any more ; without psychiatric treatment , you may well be unable to <fend.01>fend</fend.01> <ARG1-for> for yourself </ARG1-for> <ARGM-TMP> ever again </ARGM-TMP> . ''
<ARG0> Some of the homeless </ARG0> , <ARGM-ADV> obviously </ARGM-ADV> , <have.03>had</have.03> <ARG1> pre-existing mental illness or addiction </ARG1> .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG1> many others </ARG1> have <fall.01>fallen</fall.01> <ARGM-DIR> through cracks in the economy </ARGM-DIR> <ARG4-into> into the grim , brutal world of our city streets </ARG4-into> .
<ARG0> You </ARG0> <dismiss.02>dismiss</dismiss.02> <ARG2-as> as `` sentimental '' </ARG2-as> <ARG1> the view that the reduction of federal housing-assistance programs by 77 % might have played a significant role in the increased number of men and women sleeping on our city streets during the Reagan-Bush years </ARG1> .
There is no sign that <ARG0> you </ARG0> <bother.02>bothered</bother.02> <ARG1> to consider the inverse of your logic : namely , that mental illness and substance abuse might be to some degree consequences rather than causes of homelessness </ARG1> .
<ARG1> Your research </ARG1> <stop.01>stopped</stop.01> <ARGM-TMP> when a convenient assertion could be made </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG2-Of> Of the approximately 200 sponsors of the recent march in Washington for the homeless </ARG2-Of> , <ARG0> you </ARG0> <choose.01>chose</choose.01> <ARG1> to cite such groups as the National Association of Home Builders and the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen </ARG1> , <ARGM-ADV> insinuating that the march got its major support from self-serving groups that `` know a good thing when they see it , '' and that the crusade was based on greed or the profit motive </ARGM-ADV> .
But is n't the desire for profit the <drive.02>driving</drive.02> <ARG0> force </ARG0> behind <ARG1> those who subscribe to , and advertise in , your paper </ARG1> ?
Why did <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <ARG0> you </ARG0> <mention.01>mention</mention.01> <ARG1> the YMCA or the YWCA or Catholic Charities USA or a hundred other nonprofit organizations that participated in the march </ARG1> ?
As for the findings on <ARG1> the 203 Baltimore homeless who </ARG1> <undergo.01>underwent</undergo.01> <ARG2> psychiatric examinations </ARG2> , I suggest you conduct your own survey .
<choose.01><ARG0></choose.01> <ARG1> 203 business executives , including , perhaps , someone from your own staff </ARG1> , and put them out on the streets , to be deprived for one month of their homes , families and income . </ARG0>
<ARG0> I </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <predict.01>predict</predict.01> <ARG1> that within a short time most of them would find Thunderbird a satisfactory substitute for Chivas Regal and that their `` normal '' phobias , anxieties , depressions and substance abuse would increase dramatically </ARG1> .
<ARG0> ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS Inc. </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it plans to raise 175 million to 180 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 148.9 million to $ 153.3 million -RRB- through a private placement of perpetual preferred shares .
Perpetual <prefer.01>preferred</prefer.01> <ARG1> shares </ARG1> are n't retractable by the holders , the company said .
<ARG0> Rogers </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the shares will be convertible into Class B shares , <ARGM-DIS> but </ARGM-DIS> <ARG1> that the company has the option to redeem the shares before a conversion takes place </ARG1> .
<ARG0> A spokesman for the Toronto cable television and telecommunications concern </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the coupon rate has n't yet been fixed , but will probably be set at around 8 % .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <decline.02>declined</decline.02> <ARG1> to discuss other terms of the issue </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The House </ARG0> <pass.01>passed</pass.01> <ARG1> legislation designed to make it easier for the Transportation Department to block airline leveraged buy-outs </ARG1> .
<ARG1> The final vote </ARG1> <come.01>came</come.01> <ARGM-TMP> after the House rejected Republican efforts to weaken the bill and approved two amendments sought by organized labor </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> The Bush administration </ARG0> has <threaten.01>threatened</threaten.01> <ARG1> to veto such a bill </ARG1> <ARGM-CAU> because of what it views as an undesirable intrusion into the affairs of industry </ARGM-CAU> , but the 300-113 vote suggests that supporters have the potential to override a veto .
The broader question is <ARGM-LOC> where </ARGM-LOC> <ARG1> the Senate </ARG1> <stand.01>stands</stand.01> <ARG2-on> on the issue </ARG2-on> .
While <ARG0> the Senate Commerce Committee </ARG0> has <approve.01>approved</approve.01> <ARG1> legislation similar to the House bill on airline leveraged buy-outs </ARG1> , the measure has n't yet come to the full floor .
Although <ARG1> the legislation </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <apply.02>apply</apply.02> <ARG2-to> to acquisitions involving any major airline </ARG2-to> , it is aimed at giving the Transportation Department the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt .
<ARG0> `` The purpose of the bill is to <put.01>put</put.01> <ARG1> the brakes </ARG1> <ARG2-on> on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would impede safety or a carrier 's ability to compete </ARG2-on> , '' Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt , -LRB- R. , Ark . -RRB- said . </ARG0>
The bill , as <ARG1> it </ARG1> was <approve.01>approved</approve.01> <ARG0-by> by the House Public Works and Transportation Committee </ARG0-by> , would give the Transportation Department up to 50 days to review any purchase of 15 % or more of the stock in an airline .
<ARG2> The department </ARG2> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> be <require.01>required</require.01> <ARG1> to block the buy-out </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired ; its ability to compete would be sharply diminished ; it would be put into foreign control ; or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline-related assets -- unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> The House </ARG0> <approve.01>approved</approve.01> <ARG1> an amendment offered by Rep. Peter DeFazio -LRB- D. , Ore. -RRB- that would , in addition to the previous criteria , also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier 's employees , or their wages or benefits </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Rep. James Traficant -LRB- D. , Ohio -RRB- </ARG0> , <say.01>said</say.01> the amendment , which passed 271-147 , would `` let the American worker know that we consider them occasionally . ''
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> Rep. Hammerschmidt </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that the provision , which he dubbed a `` special interest '' amendment , was likely to make the bill even more controversial </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> On Tuesday </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> the House </ARG0> <approve.01>approved</approve.01> <ARG1> a labor-backed amendment that would require the Transportation Department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code </ARG1> .
<ARG1> The provision </ARG1> , <call.01>called</call.01> <ARG2> the `` two-time-losers '' amendment </ARG2> <ARG0-by> by its supporters </ARG0-by> , apparently was aimed at preventing Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo from attempting to take over another airline .
<ARG1> You </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> now </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-MOD> may </ARGM-MOD> <drop.02>drop</drop.02> by <ARG4> the Voice of America offices in Washington </ARG4> and read the text of what the Voice is broadcasting to those 130 million people around the world who tune in to it each week .
<ARG0> You </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-ADV> even </ARGM-ADV> <take.01>take</take.01> <ARG1> notes -- extensive notes , for the Voice folks wo n't look over your shoulder -- about what you read </ARG1> .
<ARG0> You </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <do.02>do</do.02> <ARG1> all this </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> even if you 're not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of Congress </ARGM-ADV> .
And <ARG0> my newspaper </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <print.01>print</print.01> <ARG1> the text of those broadcasts </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> Until the other day </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> you as an ordinary citizen of this democracy </ARG0> <have.03>had</have.03> <ARG1> no right to see what your government was telling your cousins around the world </ARG1> .
<ARGM-DIS> And </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> I </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> apparently </ARGM-ADV> <have.03>had</have.03> <ARG1> no right to print hither what the Voice was booming to yon </ARG1> .
The theory was that the Voice is a propaganda agency and <ARG0> this government </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> should </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <propagandize.01>propagandize</propagandize.01> <ARG1> its own people </ARG1> .
<ARG1> That </ARG1> <sound.01>sounds</sound.01> <ARG2> neat </ARG2> , but this government -- any government -- propagandizes its own people every day .
Propaganda is just information to <support.01>support</support.01> <ARG1> a viewpoint </ARG1> , and the beauty of a democracy is that it enables you to hear or read every viewpoint and then make up your own mind on an issue .
The restrictions on <view.01>viewing</view.01> and dissemination <ARG1-of> of Voice material </ARG1-of> were especially absurd : An agency in the information business was not being allowed to inform .
<ARGM-TMP> In June 1988 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> I </ARG0> <write.01>wrote</write.01> <ARGM-LOC> in this space </ARGM-LOC> <ARG1-about> about this issue </ARG1-about> .
<assume.02><ARG0></assume.02> it was n't one of those columns that you clipped and put on the refrigerator door , I 'll review the facts . </ARG0>
The Voice of America is <ARG0> a government agency that </ARG0> <broadcast.01>broadcasts</broadcast.01> <ARG1> news and views -- some might say propaganda -- </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> in 43 languages </ARGM-MNR> <ARG2-to> to 130 million listeners around the world </ARG2-to> .
<ARG0> It </ARG0> <do.02>does</do.02> <ARG1> a first-rate job </ARG1> .
<ARG3-for> Its budget $ 184 million -- </ARG3-for> is <pay.01>paid</pay.01> for <ARG0-by> by you </ARG0-by> .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> a 1948 law </ARG0> <bar.01>barred</bar.01> <ARG1> the `` dissemination '' of that material in the U.S. </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The law </ARG0> <let.01>let</let.01> <ARG1> scholars , reporters and researchers read texts of VOA material </ARG1> , <ARGM-LOC> only at VOA headquarters in Washington </ARGM-LOC> , but it barred them from copying texts .
`` <ARG1> You </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> may </ARGM-MOD> <come.01>come</come.01> <ARG4-by> by the agency </ARG4-by> <ARGM-PNC> to read but not copy either manually or by photocopying </ARGM-PNC> , '' a Voice official explained when I asked .
What if <ARG0> I </ARG0> <tune.02>tune</tune.02> in <ARG1> my short-wave radio </ARG1> , transcribe an editorial or program , and print it in my newspaper ?
`` Nor are <ARG0> you </ARG0> free to <reprint.01>reprint</reprint.01> <ARG1> such material </ARG1> , '' I was advised .
<ARG1> That </ARG1> <sound.01>sounded</sound.01> <ARG2-like> a lot like censorship </ARG2-like> , so after years of letters and conversations that went nowhere , I sued .
<ARGM-TMP> A couple of weeks ago </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> I </ARG0> <lose.03>lost</lose.03> <ARG1> the case </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> in federal district court in Des Moines </ARGM-LOC> .
At least , that 's the way <ARG1> it </ARG1> was <report.01>reported</report.01> .
And , <ARGM-ADV> indeed </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG1> the lawsuit </ARG1> was <dismiss.01>dismissed</dismiss.01> .
But <ARG0> I </ARG0> -- I <like.01>like</like.01> <ARG1> to think of it in terms of we , all of us </ARG1> -- won the point .
For <ARG1> a funny thing </ARG1> <happen.01>happened</happen.01> <ARGM-TMP> on the way to the ruling </ARGM-TMP> : The United States Information Agency , which runs the Voice , changed its position on three key points .
-- <ARG0> The USIA </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> that , on reflection , of course I could print anything I could get my hands on .
The word dissemination , <ARG0> it </ARG0> <decide.01>decided</decide.01> , referred only to itself .
`` <ARG0> The USIA </ARG0> <ARGM-MNR> officially and publicly </ARGM-MNR> <declare.02>declared</declare.02> <ARG1> the absolute right of everyone except the USIA to disseminate agency program materials in the United States </ARG1> , '' my lawyer , the scholarly Mark McCormick of Des Moines , said in a memo pointing out the facts and trying to make me feel good after the press reported that I had lost .
<ARG0> The court </ARG0> <note.XX>noted</note.XX> <ARG1> the new USIA position </ARG1> but , just in case , officially found `` that Congress did not intend to preclude plaintiffs from disseminating USIA information domestically . ''
-- <ARG0> The USIA </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that , on reflection , anyone could view the VOA materials , not just the reporters , scholars , researchers and congressmen who are mentioned in the statute </ARG1> .
`` <ARG0> The USIA </ARG0> <ARGM-MNR> publicly and officially </ARGM-MNR> <state.01>stated</state.01> <ARGM-LOC> in the litigation </ARGM-LOC> <ARG1> that all persons are allowed access to the materials , notwithstanding the statutory designations , because the USIA has determined that it will not check the credentials of any person appearing and requesting to see the materials </ARG1> , '' Mr. McCormick noted .
-- <ARGM-DIS> And </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> the USIA </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that all of us could take extensive notes </ARG1> .
`` <ARG0> The agency </ARG0> <ARGM-MNR> publicly and officially </ARGM-MNR> <declare.02>declared</declare.02> <ARGM-LOC> in the lawsuit </ARGM-LOC> <ARG1> that persons who examine the materials may make notes and , while the agency position is that persons may not take verbatim notes , no one will check to determine what notes a person has taken </ARG1> , '' Mr. McCormick reported .
<ARG0> I </ARG0> had <seek.01>sought</seek.01> , <ARGM-LOC> in my suit </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG1> the right to print Voice material , which had been denied me </ARG1> , and I had sought a right to receive the information , arguing in effect that a right to print government information is n't very helpful if I have no right to get the information .
But <ARG0> the court </ARG0> <disagree.01>disagreed</disagree.01> .
`` <ARG0> The First Amendment </ARG0> <proscribe.01>proscribes</proscribe.01> <ARG1> the government </ARG1> <ARG2-from> from passing laws abridging the right to free speech </ARG2-from> , '' Judge Donald O'Brien ruled .
`` <ARG0> The First Amendment </ARG0> does <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> <prescribe.01>prescribe</prescribe.01> <ARG1> a duty upon the government to assure easy access to information for members of the press </ARG1> . ''
<ARG0> You </ARG0> <have.03>have</have.03> <ARG1> a right to read Voice of America scripts </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> if you do n't mind traveling to Washington every week or so and visiting the Voice office during business hours </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> I </ARG0> <have.03>have</have.03> <ARG1> a right to print those scripts </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> if I go there and laboriously -- but no longer surreptitiously -- copy them out in long hand </ARGM-ADV> .
But <ARG0> neither of us </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <copy.01>copy</copy.01> <ARG1> the material </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> on a Xerox machine </ARGM-MNR> or have it sent to us .
In <ARGM-TMP> an era when </ARGM-TMP> <ARG0> every government agency </ARG0> <have.03>has</have.03> <ARG1> a public-relations machine that sends you stuff whether you want it or not </ARG1> , this does seem odd .
<ARGM-DIS> Indeed </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> Judge O'Brien </ARG0> <rule.01>ruled</rule.01> <ARG1> that `` it would be easy to conclude that the USIA 's position is ` inappropriate or even stupid , ' '' but it 's the law </ARG1> .
So the next step , <ARG0> I </ARG0> <suspect.01>suspect</suspect.01> , is to try to get the law changed .
We -LRB- <ARG0> I </ARG0> <assume.02>assume</assume.02> you 're in this with me at this point -RRB- need to get three words -- `` for examination only '' -- eliminated from the law .
<ARG0> Section 501 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> Voice material shall be available to certain of us -LRB- but now , thanks to the USIA 's new position , all of us -RRB- `` for examination only . ''
If those words were n't there , <ARG0> the nice people at the Voice </ARG0> would be able to <send.01>send</send.01> <ARG2> you </ARG2> <ARG1> the information </ARG1> or , at the very least , let you photocopy it .
`` <ARG0> You </ARG0> have ... <raise.01>raised</raise.01> <ARG1> important questions which ought to be answered : What does USIA say about America abroad ; how do we say it ; and how can American taxpayers get the answers to these questions ? '' </ARG1> a man wrote me a couple of years ago .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <have.03>had</have.03> <ARG1> no answers </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> then </ARGM-TMP> .

`` <ARG1> The profit motive of the major shareholders </ARG1> has <ARGM-DIS> clearly </ARGM-DIS> <change.01>changed</change.01> <ARG2-for> for the better </ARG2-for> , '' said John McMillin , a food industry analyst for Prudential-Bache in New York .
Mr. McGovern was <ARGM-LOC> widely </ARGM-LOC> <see.01>seen</see.01> as sales , and not profit , oriented .
`` <ARG0> New managers </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <think.01>think</think.01> <ARGM-MNR> a little more like Wall Street </ARGM-MNR> , '' Mr. McMillin added .
Some of the surge in the stock 's price <appear.02>appeared</appear.02> to be linked to revived takeover speculation , which has contributed to volatility of Campbell shares in recent months .
Campbell 's international businesses , particularly in the U.K. and Italy , <appear.02>appear</appear.02> to be at the heart of its problems .
<ARG1> Growth </ARG1> has <fall.01>fallen</fall.01> <ARG4> short of targets </ARG4> and operating earnings are far below results in U.S. units .
For example , Campbell is a distant third in the U.K. <freeze.01>frozen</freeze.01> <ARG1> foods </ARG1> market , where it recently paid 24 times earnings for Freshbake Foods PLC and wound up with far more capacity than it could use .
Similarly , <ARG1> Campbell 's Italian biscuit operation , D. Lazzaroni & Co. , </ARG1> has been <hurt.01>hurt</hurt.01> <ARG2-by> by overproduction and distribution problems </ARG2-by> .
<ARG0> Such problems </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <require.01>require</require.01> <ARG1> considerable skill </ARG1> <ARGM-PRD> to resolve </ARGM-PRD> .
<ARGM-DIS> However </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> neither Mr. Baum nor Mr. Harper </ARG0> <have.03>has</have.03> <ARG1> much international experience </ARG1> .
Mr. Baum , a seasoned marketer who is <say.01>said</say.01> to have a good rapport with Campbell employees , will have responsibility for all domestic operations except the Pepperidge Farm unit .
Mr. Harper , a veteran of several <manufacture.01>manufacturing</manufacture.01> <ARG0> companies </ARG0> who joined Campbell in 1986 , will take charge of all overseas operations as well as Pepperidge .
<ARGM-LOC> In an joint interview </ARGM-LOC> yesterday , <ARG0> both men </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> they would like to be the company 's next chief executive .
<ARG0> Mr. McGovern , 63 , </ARG0> had been under intense pressure from the board to <boost.01>boost</boost.01> <ARG1> Campbell 's mediocre performance </ARG1> <ARG4-to> to the level of other food companies </ARG4-to> .
<ARG1> The board </ARG1> is <dominate.01>dominated</dominate.01> <ARG0-by> by the heirs of the late John T. Dorrance Jr. , who controlled about 58 % of Campbell 's stock when he died in April </ARG0-by> .
<ARGM-TMP> In recent months </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Mr. Dorrance 's children and other family members </ARG0> have <push.02>pushed</push.02> <ARG2-for> for improved profitability and higher returns on their equity </ARG2-for> .
<ARGM-TMP> In August </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> the company </ARG0> <take.15>took</take.15> <ARG1> a $ 343 million pretax charge against fiscal 1989 earnings </ARG1> when it announced a world-wide restructuring plan .
<ARG0> The plan </ARG0> <call.01>calls</call.01> <ARG1-for> for closing at least nine plants and eliminating about 3,600 jobs </ARG1-for> .
But <ARG0> analysts </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> early results from the reorganization have been disappointing , especially in Europe , and there were signs that the board became impatient .
<ARG0> Campbell officials </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> Mr. McGovern was n't available yesterday to discuss the circumstances of his departure .
The company 's <prepare.01>prepared</prepare.01> <ARG1> statement </ARG1> quoted him as saying , `` The CEO succession is well along and I 've decided for personal reasons to take early retirement . ''
But <ARG0> people familiar with the agenda of the board 's meeting last week in London </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> Mr. McGovern was fired .
<ARG0> Mr. McGovern himself </ARG0> had <say.01>said</say.01> <ARGM-MNR> repeatedly </ARGM-MNR> <ARG1> that he intended to stay on until he reached the conventional retirement age of 65 in October 1991 , `` unless I get fired </ARG1> . ''
<ARG0> Campbell </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> Mr. McGovern had withdrawn his name as a candidate for re-election as a director at the annual shareholder meeting , scheduled for Nov. 17 .
<ARGM-TMP> For fiscal 1989 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Mr. McGovern </ARG0> <receive.01>received</receive.01> <ARG1> a salary of $ 877,663 </ARG1> .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <own.01>owns</own.01> <ARG1> about 45,000 shares of Campbell stock </ARG1> and has options to buy more than 100,000 additional shares .
<ARGM-TMP> During Mr. McGovern 's nine-year term as president </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> the company 's sales </ARG1> <rise.01>rose</rise.01> <ARG4-to> to $ 5.7 billion </ARG4-to> <ARG3-from> from $ 2.8 billion </ARG3-from> and net income increased to $ 274 million from $ 130 million , the statement said .
<ARG0> Mr. Baum </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> he and Mr. Harper both advocated closing some plants as long ago as early 1988 .
`` <ARG0> You </ARG0> 've <get.06>got</get.06> <ARG1> to make the restructuring work </ARG1> , '' said Mr. Baum .
`` <ARG0> You </ARG0> 've <get.06>got</get.06> <ARG1> to make those savings now </ARG1> . ''
<ARG0> Mr. Harper </ARG0> <express.01>expressed</express.01> <ARG1> confidence that he and Mr. Baum can convince the board of their worthiness to run the company </ARG1> .
`` <ARG0> We </ARG0> <look.01>look</look.01> <ARG1-upon> upon this </ARG1-upon> <ARG2-as> as a great opportunity to prove the fact that we have a tremendous management team </ARG2-as> , '' he said .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <predict.01>predicted</predict.01> <ARG1> that the board would give the current duo until early next year before naming a new chief executive </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Mr. Baum </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the two have orders to `` focus on bottom-line profits '' and to `` take a hard look at our businesses -- what is good , what is not so good . ''
<ARG0> Analysts </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> generally </ARGM-ADV> <applaud.01>applaud</applaud.01> <ARG1> the performance of Campbell U.S.A. , the company 's largest division , which posted 6 % unit sales growth and a 15 % improvement in operating profit for fiscal 1989 </ARG1> .
`` <ARGM-MNR> The way that </ARGM-MNR> <ARG0> we </ARG0> 've been <manage.01>managing</manage.01> <ARG1> Campbell U.S.A. </ARG1> can hopefully spread to other areas of the company , '' Mr. Baum said .
<ARGM-LOC> In the interview at headquarters yesterday afternoon </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> both men </ARG0> <exude.01>exuded</exude.01> <ARG1> confidence </ARG1> and seemed to work well together .
`` <ARG0> You </ARG0> 've <get.02>got</get.02> <ARG1> two champions sitting right before you </ARG1> , '' said Mr. Baum .

<ARG0> Mr. Bernstein </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> he will stay until Dec. 31 and work with his successor , who is to be named soon .
<ARG0> Mr. Newhouse </ARG0> , <ARGM-TMP> meanwhile </ARGM-TMP> , <insist.01>insisted</insist.01> <ARG1> that he is n't unhappy with Mr. Bernstein or the performance of Random House , the largest trade publishing house in the U.S. </ARG1> .

<ARG0> Bob </ARG0> <have.03>has</have.03> <ARG1> an agenda </ARG1> and this seemed like the natural time . ''
<ARG0> Publishing officials </ARG0> <believe.01>believe</believe.01> <ARG1> that while Random House has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent years , some of the bigger ones have n't been absorbed so easily </ARG1> .
<ARG1> Crown Publishing Group </ARG1> , <acquire.01>acquired</acquire.01> <ARGM-TMP> last year </ARGM-TMP> , is said to be turning in disappointing results .
<ARGM-ADV> As a private company </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> Random House </ARG0> does <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <report.01>report</report.01> <ARG1> its earnings </ARG1> .
Mr. Bernstein , who <succeed.02>succeeded</succeed.02> <ARG1> Bennett Cerf </ARG1> , has been only the second president of Random House since it was founded in 1925 .
<ARG1> Speculation on his successor </ARG1> <center.01>centers</center.01> <ARG2-on> on a number of division heads at the house </ARG2-on> .
<ARG2> Possible candidates </ARG2> <include.01>include</include.01> <ARG1> Susan Petersen , president of Ballantine\/Del Rey\/Fawcett , Random House 's huge and successful paperback division </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Some </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> Anthony Cheetham , head of a recently acquired British company , Century Hutchinson , could be chosen .
There is also speculation that <ARG0> Mr. Newhouse </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <bring.01>bring</bring.01> <ARG3> in </ARG3> a powerhouse businessman or another Newhouse family member to run the business side , in combination with a publishing executive like Robert Gottlieb , who left Random House 's Alfred A. Knopf to run the New Yorker , also owned by the Newhouse family .
<ARGM-NEG> Not </ARGM-NEG> <include.01>included</include.01> <ARG2-on> on the most-likely-successor list </ARG2-on> are <ARG1> Joni Evans , recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for Random House , and Sonny Mehta , president of the prestigious Alfred A. Knopf unit </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> When </ARGM-TMP> <ARG0> Ms. Evans </ARG0> <take.XX>took</take.XX> <ARG1> her job </ARG1> , several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor were n't included partly because she did n't wish to be a full-time administrator .
<ARG1> Mr. Mehta </ARG1> is <ARGM-MNR> widely </ARGM-MNR> <view.02>viewed</view.02> <ARG2-as> as a brilliant editor but a less-than-brilliant administrator </ARG2-as> and his own departure was rumored recently .
Mr. Bernstein , <ARG1> a tall , energetic man who </ARG1> is <ARGM-MNR> widely </ARGM-MNR> <respect.01>respected</respect.01> <ARG2-as> as a publishing executive </ARG2-as> , has spent much of his time in recent years on human rights issues .
<ARG0> Congress </ARG0> <learn.01>learned</learn.01> <ARGM-TMP> during the Reagan administration </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> that it could intimidate the executive branch by uttering again and again the same seven words : `` Provided , that no funds shall be spent </ARG1> ... . ''
<ARG1> This phrase </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> once again </ARGM-TMP> is <find.01>found</find.01> <ARGM-LOC> throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through Congress </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG0> It </ARG0> <signal.01>signals</signal.01> <ARG1> Congress 's attempt , under the pretext of guarding the public purse , to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in Article II of the Constitution </ARG1> .
<ARG1> This species of congressional action </ARG1> is <predicate.01>predicated</predicate.01> <ARG2-on> on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional </ARG2-on> .
<ARG0> The appropriations clause </ARG0> <state.01>states</state.01> <ARG1> that `` No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury , but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law </ARG1> ... . ''
The <prevail.02>prevailing</prevail.02> <ARG1> interpretation </ARG1> of the clause on Capitol Hill is that it gives Congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability to withhold funding .
<ARG1> This interpretation </ARG1> was <ARGM-ADV> officially </ARGM-ADV> <endorse.01>endorsed</endorse.01> <ARG0-by> by Congress </ARG0-by> <ARGM-TMP> in 1987 </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-LOC> in the Iran-Contra Report </ARGM-LOC> .
As <ARG0> partisans of congressional power </ARG0> <understand.01>understand</understand.01> , a `` power of the purse '' so broadly construed would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of powers .
<ARG1> It </ARG1> is <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> <support.01>supported</support.01> <ARG0-by> by the text or history of the Constitution </ARG0-by> .
<ARG0> The framers </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> hardly </ARGM-ADV> <discuss.01>discussed</discuss.01> <ARG1> the appropriations clause </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 </ARGM-LOC> , <ARGM-ADV> according to Madison 's notes </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> To the extent they did , their concern was to <ensure.01>ensure</ensure.01> <ARG1> fiscal accountability </ARG1> . </ARG0>
<ARGM-DIS> Moreover </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> the framers </ARG0> <believe.01>believed</believe.01> that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation .
<ARG0> It </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <contradict.01>contradict</contradict.01> <ARG1> that objective </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> if the appropriations clause -LRB- technically a limitation on legislative power -RRB- could be read as placing the president on Congress 's short leash , making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress </ARGM-ADV> .
As <ARG1> it </ARG1> <go.XX>went</go.XX> <ARG4-to> to the conference panel now deliberating </ARG4-to> , the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public 's money .
During the <come.01>coming</come.01> <ARG1> weeks </ARG1> , President Bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them -- or , alternatively , to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II , and thus void and severable .
<ARG0> The 1990 appropriations legislation </ARG0> <attempt.01>attempts</attempt.01> <ARG1> to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Article II </ARG0> <place.01>places</place.01> <ARG2-on> on the president </ARG2-on> <ARG1> the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of the U.S. </ARG1> .
<ARG0> It </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <empower.01>empowers</empower.01> <ARG1> the president </ARG1> <ARG2> to make recess appointments , without Senate approval </ARG2> : `` The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate , by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session . ''
<ARGM-DIS> Yet </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office </ARG0> <provide.01>provides</provide.01> : `` <ARG1> No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person </ARG1> . ''
<ARGM-DIS> Thus </ARGM-DIS> , <ARGM-MNR> with one brief passage in an appropriations bill </ARGM-MNR> , <ARG0> Congress </ARG0> <repeal.01>repeals</repeal.01> <ARG1> the president 's power to make recess appointments under Article II </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Section 605 </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <impose.01>imposes</impose.01> <ARG1> unconstitutional conditions </ARG1> <ARG2-on> on the president 's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing </ARG2-on> .
<ARG0> The language of the appropriations rider </ARG0> <imply.01>implies</imply.01> that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person 's salary .
<ARG0> The president </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-ADV> probably </ARGM-ADV> <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> <avoid.01>avoid</avoid.01> <ARG1> this restriction </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> by choosing people willing to serve without pay </ARGM-MNR> , <ARGM-CAU> because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government </ARGM-CAU> .
<ARG0> The 1990 appropriations bills </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <contain.01>contain</contain.01> <ARG1> a number of `` muzzling '' provisions that violate the recommendation clause in Article II of the Constitution </ARG1> .
Muzzling provisions , which <ARGM-MOD> might </ARGM-MOD> be <call.01>called</call.01> <ARG2> `` blindfold laws '' </ARG2> <ARGM-DIS> as well </ARGM-DIS> , prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options , let alone from recommending them to Congress .
<ARG0> Such laws </ARG0> <violate.01>violate</violate.01> the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress , but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations .
<ARGM-ADV> Typically </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> these laws </ARG0> <seek.01>seek</seek.01> <ARG1> to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market-oriented alternatives to regulations </ARG1> .
Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that <prevent.01>prevents</prevent.01> <ARG1> the president 's Office of Management and Budget </ARG1> <ARG2-from> from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny </ARG2-from> .
There is something inherently suspect about <ARG0> Congress 's </ARG0> <prohibit.01>prohibiting</prohibit.01> <ARG1> the executive </ARG1> <ARG2-from> from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other </ARG2-from> .
Perhaps <ARG1> none of the unconstitutional conditions </ARG1> <contain.01>contained</contain.01> <ARG0-in> in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 </ARG0-in> better illustrates Congress 's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive-office bill : `` None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States . ''
<ARG1> This provision </ARG1> <amount.02>amounts</amount.02> <ARG2-to> to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law </ARG2-to> , <ARGM-CAU> since a one-house resolution could be said to be `` duly adopted '' even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto </ARGM-CAU> .
<ARG0> The Supreme Court 's decision in INS v. Chadha </ARG0> <hold.02>held</hold.02> that <ARG1> legislative vetoes are unconstitutional </ARG1> .
<ARG0> President Bush </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> should </ARGM-MOD> <veto.01>veto</veto.01> <ARG1> appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives </ARG1> .
If <ARG1> President Bush </ARG1> <fail.01>fails</fail.01> <ARG2> to do so in his first year </ARG2> , he will invite Congress , for the remainder of his presidency , to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes .
<ARG1> What </ARG1> <become.01>becomes</become.01> <ARG2> custom </ARG2> <ARGM-LOC> in the Bush administration </ARGM-LOC> will only become more difficult for future presidents , including Democrats , to undo .
<ARG0> President Reagan </ARG0> <learn.01>learned</learn.01> <ARG1> that lesson </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> By 1987 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> then-Speaker Jim Wright </ARG0> was <discuss.01>discussing</discuss.01> <ARG1> arms control </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> in Moscow </ARGM-LOC> <ARG2-with> with Mikhail Gorbachev </ARG2-with> and then attempting to direct the president , through an appropriations rider , to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II .
If a veto is unworkable because <ARG0> it </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <leave.02>leave</leave.02> <ARG1> part of the executive branch </ARG1> <ARG2> unfunded </ARG2> , the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision , declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable .
<ARG0> The Constitution </ARG0> does <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> <ARGM-MNR> expressly </ARGM-MNR> <give.01>give</give.01> <ARG2> the president </ARG2> <ARG1> such power </ARG1> .
<ARGM-DIS> However </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> the president </ARG0> does <have.03>have</have.03> <ARG1> a duty not to violate the Constitution </ARG1> .
Excision of <ARG0> appropriations riders that </ARG0> <trespass.01>trespass</trespass.01> <ARG1-on> on the president 's duties and prerogative under Article II </ARG1-on> would be different from the line-item veto .
<ARG0> As <discuss.01>discussed</discuss.01> <ARGM-ADV> in the context of controlling federal spending </ARGM-ADV> , the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives . </ARG0>
The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of <ARGM-EXT> far more </ARGM-EXT> <limit.01>limited</limit.01> <ARG1> applicability </ARG1> .
<ARG0> One </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <argue.01>argue</argue.01> <ARG1> that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers </ARG1> .
There is no downside if <ARG0> the president </ARG0> <assert.03>asserts</assert.03> <ARG1> a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills </ARG1> .
If <ARG0> Congress </ARG0> <do.02>does</do.02> <ARG1> nothing </ARG1> , President Bush will have won .
If <ARG0> Congress </ARG0> <take.01>takes</take.01> <ARG1> the dispute </ARG1> <ARGM-DIR> to the Supreme Court </ARGM-DIR> -LRB- assuming it can establish standing to sue -RRB- , President Bush might win .
<ARGM-DIS> In that case </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> he </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> might </ARGM-MOD> <receive.01>receive</receive.01> an opinion <ARG2-from> from the court </ARG2-from> that is a vindication of the president 's right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the framers thought should be entrusted to the executive .
If <ARG0> President Bush </ARG0> <lose.03>loses</lose.03> <ARGM-LOC> at the court </ARGM-LOC> , it might be disappointing , as Morrison v. Olson was for the Reagan administration .
<ARGM-DIS> Moreover </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> the electorate </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> have <receive.01>received</receive.01> <ARG1> a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice </ARG1> .
As <ARG1> it </ARG1> <stand.01>stands</stand.01> <ARGM-TMP> now </ARGM-TMP> , Congress presumes after the Reagan administration that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down .
<ARG0> President Bush </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> should </ARGM-MOD> <set.01>set</set.01> <ARG1> things </ARG1> <ARG2> straight </ARG2> .
<ARGM-ADV> If <ARG0> he </ARG0> does not </ARGM-ADV> , he <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <help.01>help</help.01> <ARG1> realize Madison 's fear in The Federalist No. 48 of a legislature `` everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex </ARG1> . ''

<ARG1> His longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause </ARG1> is to <appear.01>appear</appear.01> <ARGM-LOC> in the Duke Law Journal </ARGM-LOC> <ARGM-TMP> later this year </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARGM-ADV> Despite one of the most devastating droughts on record </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG1> net cash income in the Farm Belt </ARG1> <rise.01>rose</rise.01> <ARG4-to> to a new high of $ 59.9 billion </ARG4-to> <ARGM-TMP> last year </ARGM-TMP> .
Net cash income -- <ARG1> the amount </ARG1> <leave.02>left</leave.02> <ARGM-LOC> in farmers ' pockets </ARGM-LOC> <ARGM-TMP> after deducting expenses from gross cash income </ARGM-TMP> -- increased in 33 states in 1988 , as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices , the department 's Economic Research Service reported yesterday .
<ARG0> Most of those states </ARG0> <set.02>set</set.02> <ARG1> farm income records </ARG1> .
<ARG1> The worst crop damage </ARG1> <occur.01>occurred</occur.01> <ARGM-LOC> in the Midwestern Corn Belt and the northern Great Plains </ARGM-LOC> .
What <save.02>saved</save.02> <ARG1> many farmers </ARG1> <ARG2-from> from a bad year </ARG2-from> was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had `` mortgaged '' to the government under price-support loan programs .
With <ARG1> prices </ARG1> <soar.01>soaring</soar.01> , they were able to sell the reclaimed commodities at `` considerable profit , '' the agency 's 240-page report said .
In <ARGM-EXT> less </ARGM-EXT> <parch.01>parched</parch.01> <ARG1> areas </ARG1> , meanwhile , farmers who had little or no loss of production profited greatly from the higher prices .
<ARGM-ADV> To the surprise of some analysts </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG1> net cash income </ARG1> <rise.01>rose</rise.01> <ARGM-LOC> in some of the hardest-hit states , including Indiana , Illinois , Nebraska and the Dakotas </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG0> Analysts </ARG0> <attribute.01>attributed</attribute.01> <ARG1> the increases </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> partly </ARGM-ADV> <ARG2-to> to the $ 4 billion disaster-assistance package enacted by Congress </ARG2-to> .
<ARG0> Last year 's record net cash income </ARG0> <confirm.01>confirms</confirm.01> <ARG1> the farm sector 's rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s </ARG1> .
<ARG0> It </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <help.01>helps</help.01> <ARG1> explain the reluctance of the major farm lobbies and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the 1985 farm program next year </ARG1> .
<ARG1> Commodity prices </ARG1> have been <rise.01>rising</rise.01> <ARGM-TMP> in recent years </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-ADV> with the farm price index hitting record peaks earlier this year </ARGM-ADV> , <ARGM-ADV> as the government curtailed production with land-idling programs to reduce price-depressing surpluses </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARGM-TMP> At the same time </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> export demand for U.S. wheat , corn and other commodities </ARG1> <strengthen.01>strengthened</strengthen.01> , said Keith Collins , a department analyst .
<ARG1> Farmers </ARG1> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <benefit.01>benefited</benefit.01> <ARG0-from> from strong livestock prices </ARG0-from> , <ARGM-ADV> as the nation 's cattle inventory dropped close to a 30-year low </ARGM-ADV> .
`` <ARG1> All of these forces </ARG1> <come.01>came</come.01> <ARGM-REC> together </ARGM-REC> <ARGM-TMP> in 1988 </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-PNC> to benefit agriculture </ARGM-PNC> , '' Mr. Collins said .
<ARG0> California </ARG0> <lead.01>led</lead.01> <ARG1> the nation </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> with $ 6.5 billion in net cash income </ARGM-MNR> <ARGM-TMP> last year </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-ADV> followed by Texas , $ 3.9 billion ; Iowa , $ 3.4 billion ; Florida , $ 3.1 billion ; and Minnesota , $ 2.7 billion </ARGM-ADV> .
Iowa and Minnesota were among the few major farm states to <log.01>log</log.01> <ARG1> a decline in net cash income </ARG1> .
Despite federal disaster relief , the drought of 1988 was a severe financial setback for an <estimate.01>estimated</estimate.01> <ARG1> 10,000 to 15,000 farmers </ARG1> , according to the department .
<ARG0> Many </ARG0> <lose.02>lost</lose.02> <ARG1> their farms </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Department economists </ARG0> do <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <expect.01>expect</expect.01> <ARG1> 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 was </ARG1> .
Indeed , <ARG1> net cash income </ARG1> is likely to <fall.01>fall</fall.01> <ARGM-TMP> this year </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-ADV> as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARGM-TMP> At the same time </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> an increase of land under cultivation after the drought </ARG0> has <boost.01>boosted</boost.01> <ARG1> production of corn , soybeans and other commodities </ARG1> , <ARGM-ADV> causing a fall in prices that has been only partly cushioned by heavy grain buying by the Soviets </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARGM-TMP> Last year </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> government payments to farmers </ARG1> <slip.01>slipped</slip.01> <ARG4-to> to less than $ 14.5 billion </ARG4-to> <ARG3-from> from a record $ 16.7 billion in 1987 </ARG3-from> .
Payments are <expect.01>expected</expect.01> to range between $ 9 billion and $ 12 billion <ARGM-TMP> this year </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARGM-TMP> After years of struggling </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> the Los Angeles Herald Examiner </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <publish.01>publish</publish.01> <ARG1> its last edition </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> today </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-ADV> shut down by its parent , Hearst Corp. , following unsuccessful efforts to sell the venerable newspaper </ARGM-ADV> .
The demise of the 238,000-circulation Herald , once the nation 's largest afternoon newspaper with <ARG0> circulation </ARG0> <exceed.01>exceeding</exceed.01> <ARG1> 700,000 </ARG1> , turns the country 's second-largest city into a one-newspaper town , at least in some senses .
<ARG0> The Los Angeles Times , with a circulation of more than 1.1 million , </ARG0> <dominate.01>dominates</dominate.01> <ARG1> the region </ARG1> .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> it </ARG0> <face.01>faces</face.01> <ARG1> stiff competition in Orange County from the Orange County Register , which sells more than 300,000 copies a day , and in the San Fernando Valley from the Los Angeles Daily News , which sells more than 170,000 </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Nearby cities such as Pasadena and Long Beach </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <have.03>have</have.03> <ARG1> large dailies </ARG1> .
In July , <ARGM-MNR> closely </ARGM-MNR> <hold.02>held</hold.02> <ARG1> Hearst </ARG1> , based in New York , put the paper on the block .
<ARG0> Speculation </ARG0> <have.03>had</have.03> <ARG1> it that the company was asking $ 100 million for an operation said to be losing about $ 20 million a year </ARG1> , but others said Hearst might have virtually given the paper away .
An <attempt.01>attempted</attempt.01> <ARG1> buy-out </ARG1> led by John J. McCabe , chief operating officer , never materialized , and a stream of what one staff member dismissed as `` tire-kickers and lookee-loos '' had filed through since .
<ARG2> The prospective buyers </ARG2> <include.01>included</include.01> <ARG1> investor Marvin Davis and the Toronto Sun </ARG1> .
Los Angeles is a sprawling , balkanized newspaper market , and advertisers <seem.01>seemed</seem.01> to feel they could buy space in the mammoth Times , then target a particular area with one of the regional dailies .
<ARG1> The Herald </ARG1> was <leave.01>left</leave.01> <ARG2-in> in limbo </ARG2-in> .
<ARGM-DIS> Further </ARGM-DIS> , the Herald <seem.01>seemed</seem.01> torn editorially between keeping its old-time Hearst readership -- blue-collar and sports-oriented -- and trying to provide a sprightly , upscale alternative to the sometimes staid Times .
<ARG0> Hearst </ARG0> had <flirt.01>flirted</flirt.01> <ARG1-with> with a conversion to tabloid format </ARG1-with> <ARGM-TMP> for years </ARGM-TMP> but never executed the plan .
<ARG0> The Herald </ARG0> <join.01>joins</join.01> <ARG1> the Baltimore News-American , which folded , and the Boston Herald-American , which was sold , </ARG1> <ARGM-PRD> as cornerstones of the old Hearst newspaper empire abandoned by the company in the 1980s </ARGM-PRD> .
<ARG0> Many </ARG0> <feel.02>felt</feel.02> Hearst kept the paper alive as long as it did , if marginally , because of its place in family history .
<ARG1> Its fanciful offices </ARG1> were <design.01>designed</design.01> <ARG0-by> by architect Julia Morgan , who built the Hearst castle at San Simeon </ARG0-by> .
<ARG0> William Randolph Hearst </ARG0> had <keep.01>kept</keep.01> <ARG1> an apartment </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> in the Spanish Renaissance-style building </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG0> Analysts </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the Herald 's demise does n't necessarily represent the overall condition of the newspaper industry .
`` <ARG1> The Herald was a survivor from a bygone age </ARG1> , '' <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG0> J. Kendrick Noble , a media analyst with PaineWebber Inc </ARG0> .
`` Actually , <ARG0> the long deterioration in daily newspapers </ARG0> <show.01>shows</show.01> <ARG1> signs of coming to an end </ARG1> , and the industry looks pretty healthy . ''
<found.01>Founded</found.01> <ARG2-as> as the Examiner </ARG2-as> <ARGM-TMP> in 1903 </ARGM-TMP> <ARG0-by> by Mr. Hearst </ARG0-by> , <ARG1> the Herald </ARG1> was crippled by a bitter , decade-long strike that began in 1967 and cut circulation in half .
<ARGM-MNR> Financially </ARGM-MNR> , <ARG1> it </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> never </ARGM-TMP> <recover.01>recovered</recover.01> ; editorially , it had its moments .
<ARGM-TMP> In 1979 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Hearst </ARG0> <hire.01>hired</hire.01> <ARG1> editor James Bellows , who brightened the editorial product considerably </ARG1> .
<ARG0> He and his successor , Mary Anne Dolan , </ARG0> <restore.01>restored</restore.01> <ARG1> respect for the editorial product </ARG1> , and though in recent years the paper had been limping along on limited resources , its accomplishments were notable .
<ARGM-DIS> For example </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> the Herald </ARG0> <ARGM-MNR> consistently </ARGM-MNR> <beat.03>beat</beat.03> <ARG1> its much-larger rival </ARG1> <ARG2-on> on disclosures about Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley 's financial dealings </ARG2-on> .
<ARG1> The Herald 's sports coverage and arts criticism </ARG1> were <ARGM-EXT> also </ARGM-EXT> <ARGM-MNR> highly </ARGM-MNR> <regard.01>regarded</regard.01> .
<ARG0> Robert J. Danzig , vice president and general manager of Hearst Newspapers , </ARG0> <stand.01>stood</stand.01> up <ARGM-LOC> in the paper 's newsroom </ARGM-LOC> <ARGM-TMP> yesterday </ARGM-TMP> and announced that no buyers had stepped forward and that the paper would fold , putting more than 730 full-time employees out of work .
<ARG0> Hearst </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it would provide employees with a placement service and pay them for 60 days .
<ARG0> Some long-tenured employees </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <receive.01>receive</receive.01> <ARG1> additional benefits </ARG1> , the company said .
Hours after the announcement , <ARG0> representatives of the Orange County Register </ARG0> were in a bar across the street <recruit.01>recruiting</recruit.01> .
`` <ARG0> I </ARG0> 've <ARGM-TMP> never </ARGM-TMP> <see.01>seen</see.01> <ARG1> so many people crying in one place at one time </ARG1> , '' said Bill Johnson , an assistant city editor .
`` <ARG1> So Long , L.A. </ARG1> '' was <choose.01>chosen</choose.01> <ARG4-as> as the paper 's final headline </ARG4-as> .
`` <ARG0> I </ARG0> 'm <do.02>doing</do.02> <ARG1> the main story </ARG1> , and I 'm already two beers drunk , '' said reporter Andy Furillo , whom the Times hired away several years ago but who returned to the Herald out of preference .
<ARG0> His wife </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <work.01>works</work.01> <ARG2-for> for the paper </ARG2-for> , <ARGM-ADV> as did his father </ARGM-ADV> .
Outside , <ARG0> a young pressman </ARG0> <fill.01>filling</fill.01> <ARG1> a news box </ARG1> <ARG2-with> with an extra edition headlined `` Herald Examiner Closes '' </ARG2-with> refused to take a reader 's quarter .

<ARG0> It </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it needs to make the payment by Dec. 1 to avoid a default that could lead to an acceleration of the debt .

If <ARG0> you </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> 'd </ARGM-MOD> really <ARGM-ADV> rather </ARGM-ADV> <have.03>have</have.03> <ARG1> a Buick </ARG1> , do n't leave home without the American Express card .
<ARGM-DIS> Or </ARGM-DIS> <ARGM-MNR> so </ARGM-MNR> <ARG1> the slogan </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> might </ARGM-MOD> <go.01>go</go.01> .
American Express Co. and General Motors Corp. 's <beleaguer.01>beleaguered</beleaguer.01> <ARG1> Buick division </ARG1> are joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting Buick 's sales while encouraging broader use of the American Express card .
<ARG0> The companies </ARG0> are <give.01>giving</give.01> <ARG1> four-day vacations for two </ARG1> <ARG2-to> to Buick buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the American Express green card </ARG2-to> .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> have <begin.01>begun</begin.01> <ARG1> sending letters explaining the program , which began Oct. 18 and will end Dec. 18 , to about five million card holders </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Neither company </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <disclose.01>disclose</disclose.01> <ARG1> the program 's cost </ARG1> .
<ARG1> Buick </ARG1> <approach.01>approached</approach.01> <ARG2> American Express </ARG2> about <ARGM-PNC> a joint promotion </ARGM-PNC> <ARGM-CAU> because its card holders generally have a `` good credit history '' and are `` good at making payments </ARGM-CAU> , '' says a spokeswoman for the division .
<ARG0> American Express </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <represent.01>represents</represent.01> the upscale image `` we 're trying to project , '' she adds .
<ARG0> Buick </ARG0> has been <seek.01>seeking</seek.01> <ARGM-TMP> for the past few years </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> to restore its reputation as `` the doctor 's car '' -- a product for upscale professionals </ARG1> .
Sales were roughly flat in the 1989 model year compared with a year earlier , though <ARG1> industry sales </ARG1> <fall.01>fell</fall.01> .
But since <ARG1> the 1990 model year </ARG1> <begin.01>began</begin.01> <ARGM-TMP> Oct. 1 </ARGM-TMP> , Buick sales have plunged 33 % .
For <ARG0> American Express </ARG0> , the promotion is part of an effort to <broaden.01>broaden</broaden.01> <ARG1> the use of its card for retail sales , where the company expects to get much of the future growth in its card business </ARG1> .
<ARGM-ADV> Traditionally </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG1> the card </ARG1> has been <use.01>used</use.01> <ARGM-ADV> mainly </ARGM-ADV> <ARG2-for> for travel and entertainment expenses </ARG2-for> .
<ARG0> Phillip Riese , an American Express executive vice president , </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> the promotion with Buick is his company 's first with an auto maker , but `` hopefully -LCB- will be -RCB- the first of many '' in the company 's effort to promote its green card as `` the total car-care card . ''
<ARGM-DIS> To that end </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> American Express </ARG0> has been <sign.03>signing</sign.03> up <ARG1> gasoline companies , car repair shops , tire companies and car dealers </ARG1> <ARG3> to accept the card </ARG3> .
<ARG0> Many auto dealers </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> now </ARGM-TMP> <let.01>let</let.01> <ARG1> car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the American Express card </ARG1> , but few card holders realize this , Mr. Riese says .
Until now , however , <ARG0> buyers who </ARG0> <want.01>wanted</want.01> <ARG1> to finance part of a car purchase through General Motors Acceptance Corp. </ARG1> could n't put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with truth-in-lending and state disclosure laws over finance rates , says a spokesman for the GM finance arm .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> GMAC </ARG0> <approve.01>approved</approve.01> <ARG1> the Buick program </ARG1> , he says , <ARGM-CAU> because the American Express green card requires payment in full upon billing , and so does n't carry any finance rates </ARGM-CAU> .
<ARG0> Mr. Riese </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> American Express considers GM and Buick `` very sophisticated direct-mail marketers , '' so `` by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our direct-mail capability . ''
In addition , Buick is a <ARGM-MNR> relatively </ARGM-MNR> <respect.01>respected</respect.01> <ARG1> nameplate </ARG1> among American Express card holders , says an American Express spokeswoman .
<ARGM-TMP> When </ARGM-TMP> <ARG0> the company </ARG0> <ask.01>asked</ask.01> <ARG2> members </ARG2> <ARGM-LOC> in a mailing </ARGM-LOC> <ARG1> which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases </ARG1> , Buick came in fourth among U.S. cars and in the top 10 of all cars , the spokeswoman says .
<ARG0> American Express </ARG0> <have.03>has</have.03> <ARG1> more than 24 million card holders in the U.S. </ARG1> , and over half have the green card .
<ARG0> GMAC </ARG0> <screen.01>screened</screen.01> <ARG1> the card-member list </ARG1> <ARG2-for> for holders more than 30 years old with household incomes over $ 45,000 who had n't `` missed any payments </ARG2-for> , '' the Buick spokeswoman says .
Some 3.8 million of <ARG0> the five million who </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <get.01>get</get.01> <ARG1> letters </ARG1> were preapproved for credit with GMAC .
<ARG0> These 3.8 million people </ARG0> also are eligible to <get.01>get</get.01> <ARG1> one percentage point off GMAC 's advertised finance rates , which start at 6.9 % for two-year loan contracts </ARG1> .
<ARG0> A spokesman for Visa International 's U.S. subsidiary </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards , but does n't have plans for a tie-in similar to the American Express-Buick link .
<ARG0> Three divisions at American Express </ARG0> are <work.01>working</work.01> <ARG3-with> with Buick </ARG3-with> <ARG1-on> on the promotion </ARG1-on> : the establishment services division , which is responsible for all merchants and companies that accept the card ; the travel division ; and the merchandise sales division .
<ARG2> The vacation packages </ARG2> <include.01>include</include.01> <ARG1> hotel accommodations and , in some cases , tours or tickets to local attractions , but not meals </ARG1> .
<ARG0> A buyer who </ARG0> <choose.01>chooses</choose.01> <ARG1> to fly to his destination </ARG1> must pay for his own ticket but gets a companion 's ticket free if they fly on United Airlines .
<ARGM-CAU> In lieu of the vacation </ARGM-CAU> , <ARG0> buyers </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <choose.01>choose</choose.01> <ARG2-among> among several prizes , including a grandfather clock or a stereo videocassette recorder </ARG2-among> .
<ARG0> Card holders who </ARG0> <receive.01>receive</receive.01> <ARG1> the letter </ARG1> also are eligible for a sweepstakes with Buick cars or a Hawaii vacation as prizes .
<ARGM-ADV> If <ARG0> they </ARG0> test-drive a Buick </ARGM-ADV> , they <get.01>get</get.01> <ARG1> an American Express calculator </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> A few years ago </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> the company </ARG0> <offer.01>offered</offer.01> <ARG1> two round-trip tickets on Trans World Airlines </ARG1> <ARG3-to> to buyers of its Riviera luxury car </ARG3-to> .
<ARG0> The promotion </ARG0> <help.01>helped</help.01> <ARG1> Riviera sales exceed the division 's forecast by more than 10 % </ARG1> , Buick said at the time .
<ARG0> The United Kingdom High Court </ARG0> <declare.01>declared</declare.01> <ARG2> illegal </ARG2> <ARG1> a variety of interest-rate swap transactions and options deals between a London borough council and commercial banks </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The ruling </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <lead.03>lead</lead.03> to the cancellation of huge bank debts the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions .
<ARG1> As many as 70 U.K. and international banks </ARG1> <stand.02>stand</stand.02> <ARG2> to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities </ARG2> .
<ARG1> An appeal </ARG1> is <expect.01>expected</expect.01> .
<ARGM-CAU> In response to the ruling </ARGM-CAU> , <ARG1> gilt futures </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> swiftly </ARGM-MNR> <plunge.01>plunged</plunge.01> <ARG2-EXT> more than a point </ARG2-EXT> <ARGM-TMP> yesterday </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-TMP> before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session </ARGM-TMP> .
Gilts , or British government bonds , which <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <fall.01>fell</fall.01> <ARG2-MNR> sharply </ARG2-MNR> <ARGM-TMP> initially </ARGM-TMP> , retraced some of the losses to end about 3\/8 point lower .
The council , which is <allege.01>alleged</allege.01> to have engaged in over 600 deals valued at over # 6 billion -LRB- $ 9.5 billion -RRB- , lost millions of pounds from soured swap deals .
<ARGM-TMP> At one point </ARGM-TMP> , Hammersmith is <report.01>reported</report.01> to have accounted for as much as 10 % of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings .
<ARGM-TMP> When </ARGM-TMP> <ARG0> two parties </ARG0> <engage.01>engage</engage.01> <ARG2-in> in an interest-rate swap </ARG2-in> , they are betting against each other on future rates .
Thus , <ARG1> an institution </ARG1> <obligate.01>obligated</obligate.01> <ARG2> to make fixed-rate interest payments on debt </ARG2> swaps the payments with another making floating-rate payments .
<ARGM-ADV> In most of the British transactions </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> the municipalities </ARG0> <agree.01>agreed</agree.01> <ARG1> to make floating-rate payments to banks , which would make fixed-rate payments </ARG1> .
As <ARG1> interest rates </ARG1> <rise.01>rose</rise.01> , municipalities owed the banks more than the banks were paying them .
<ARG1> The court hearing </ARG1> <begin.01>began</begin.01> <ARGM-TMP> in early October </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-ADV> at the request of Anthony Hazell , district auditor for Hammersmith , who argued that local councils are n't vested with constitutional authority to engage in such capital-markets activities </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> The council </ARG0> <back.01>backed</back.01> <ARG1> the audit commission 's stand that the swap transactions are illegal </ARG1> .
Although the Hammersmith and Fulham council was by far <ARG0> the most active local authority </ARG0> <engage.01>engaging</engage.01> <ARG2-in> in such capital-markets transactions </ARG2-in> , the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by 77 other local councils .
`` While this court ruling was only on Hammersmith , it will obviously be very persuasive in other cases of a similar nature , '' <ARG0> a solicitor </ARG0> <represent.01>representing</represent.01> <ARG1> one of the banks </ARG1> said .
<ARGM-TMP> Already </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> 10 local councils </ARG0> have <refuse.01>refused</refuse.01> <ARG1> to honor fees and payments to banks incurred during various swaps dealings </ARG1> .
<ARG1> Other financial institutions </ARG1> <involve.01>involved</involve.01> include Barclays Bank PLC , Midland Bank PLC , Security Pacific Corp. , Chemical Banking Corp. 's Chemical Bank , Citicorp 's Citibank and Mitsubishi Finance International .
If <ARG0> the banks </ARG0> <exhaust.01>exhaust</exhaust.01> <ARG1> all avenues of appeal </ARG1> , it is possible that they would seek to have the illegality ruling work both ways , some market sources said .
<ARG0> Banks </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <seek.01>seek</seek.01> <ARG1> to recover payments to local authorities in instances where the banks made net payments to councils </ARG1> .
Officials from <ARG1> the various banks </ARG1> <involve.01>involved</involve.01> are expected to meet during the next few days to consider other arrangements with local authorities that could be questionable .
<ARG0> The banks </ARG0> <have.03>have</have.03> 28 days to file an appeal against the ruling and are expected to do so shortly .
<ARGM-TMP> In the aftermath of the stock market 's gut-wrenching 190-point drop on Oct. 13 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Kidder , Peabody & Co. 's 1,400 stockbrokers across the country </ARG0> <begin.01>began</begin.01> <ARG1> a telephone and letter-writing campaign aimed at quashing the country 's second-largest program trader </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> Since October 's minicrash </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> Wall Street </ARG1> has been <shake.01>shaken</shake.01> <ARG0-by> by an explosion of resentment against program trading , the computer-driven , lightning-fast trades of huge baskets of stocks and futures that can send stock prices reeling in minutes </ARG0-by> .
But the <heat.01>heated</heat.01> <ARG1> fight </ARG1> over program trading is about much more than a volatile stock market .
The real battle is over <ARG0> who </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <control.01>control</control.01> <ARG1> that market </ARG1> and reap its huge rewards .
Program trading itself , according to <ARG0> many academics who </ARG0> have <study.01>studied</study.01> <ARG1> it </ARG1> , is merely caught in the middle of this battle , unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace .
<ARG0> The evidence </ARG0> <indicate.01>indicates</indicate.01> <ARG1> that program trading did n't , in fact , cause the market 's sharp fall on Oct. 13 , though it may have exacerbated it </ARG1> .
<ARG2-LOC> On one side of this power struggle </ARG2-LOC> <stand.01>stand</stand.01> <ARG1> the forces in ascendency on Wall Street -- the New Guard -- consisting of high-tech computer wizards at the major brokerage firms , their pension fund clients with immense pools of money , and the traders at the fast-growing Chicago futures exchanges </ARG1> .
<defend.01>Defending</defend.01> <ARG1> their ramparts </ARG1> are <ARG0> Wall Street 's Old Guard -- the traditional , stock-picking money managers , tens of thousands of stock brokers , the New York Stock Exchange 's listed companies and the clannish floor traders , known as specialists , who make markets in their stocks </ARG0> .
<ARGM-TMP> So far </ARGM-TMP> , Wall Street 's Old Guard <seem.01>seems</seem.01> to be winning the program-trading battle , successfully mobilizing public and congressional opinion to bludgeon their tormentors .
<ARG0> The Chicago Mercantile Exchange , a major futures marketplace , </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> yesterday </ARGM-TMP> <announce.01>announced</announce.01> <ARG1> the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program traders during a rapidly falling stock market </ARG1> , and the Big Board is expected today to approve some additional restrictions on program trading .
<sting.01>Stung</sting.01> <ARG0-by> by charges that their greed is turning the stock market into a gigantic crapshoot </ARG0-by> , <ARG1> almost all the big investment banking houses </ARG1> have abandoned index arbitrage , a common form of program trading , for their own accounts in the past few days .
<ARG0> A few , such as giant Merrill Lynch & Co. , </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> now </ARGM-TMP> <refuse.01>refuse</refuse.01> <ARG1> even to do index arbitrage trades for clients </ARG1> .
The Old Guard 's assault on program trading and its practitioners has been fierce and broad-based , in part because <ARG0> some Old Guard members </ARG0> <feel.02>feel</feel.02> their very livelihood is at stake .
<ARG0> Some , such as traditional money manager Neuberger & Berman , </ARG0> have <take.11>taken</take.11> out <ARG1> national newspaper advertisements demanding that market regulators `` stop the numbers racket on Wall Street </ARG1> . ''
<ARG0> Big Board stock specialists </ARG0> , <ARGM-LOC> in a bold palace revolt </ARGM-LOC> , <begin.01>began</begin.01> <ARGM-TMP> shortly after Oct. 13 </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> to telephone the corporate executives of the companies whose stock is listed on the Big Board to have them pressure the exchange to ban program trading </ARG1> .
Charles Wohlstetter , the chairman of Contel Corp. who is <rally.01>rallying</rally.01> <ARG1> other CEOs </ARG1> <ARG2-to> to the anti-program trading cause </ARG2-to> , says he has received `` countless '' letters offering support .
`` They <say.01>said</say.01> <ARGM-ADV> universally </ARGM-ADV> , without a single exception : <ARG1> Do n't even compromise </ARG1> .
<kill.01><ARG0></kill.01> <ARG1> it </ARG1> , '' he says . </ARG0>
<ARG0> Wall Street 's New Guard </ARG0> is n't likely to <take.02>take</take.02> <ARG1> all this </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> lying down </ARGM-MNR> <ARGM-TMP> for long </ARGM-TMP> , however .
<ARG0> Program trading money managers </ARG0> have <gain.02>gained</gain.02> <ARG1> control over a big chunk of the invested funds in this country </ARG1> , and the pressures on such money managers to produce consistent profits has wedded them to the ability to move rapidly in and out the market that program trading gives them .
What 's more , the last time <ARG0> major Wall Street firms </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> they were getting out of program trading -- in the aftermath of the 1987 crash -- they waited a few months and then sneaked back into it .
Even some members of the Old Guard , <ARGM-ADV> despite their current advantage </ARGM-ADV> , <seem.01>seem</seem.01> to be conceding that the future belongs with the New Guard .
Last week , Robert M. Bradley , one of the Big Board 's <ARGM-EXT> most </ARGM-EXT> <respect.01>respected</respect.01> <ARG1> floor traders </ARG1> and head of a major traders ' organization , surrendered .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <sell.01>sold</sell.01> <ARG1> his exchange seat </ARG1> and wrote a bitter letter to Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. in which he said the Big Board is too focused on machines , rather than people .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the exchange is `` headed for a real crisis '' if program trading is n't curbed .
`` <ARG0> I </ARG0> do <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> <want.01>want</want.01> <ARG1> my money invested in what I consider as nothing more than a casino </ARG1> , '' Mr. Bradley wrote .
<ARG1> The battle </ARG1> has <turn.02>turned</turn.02> <ARG2-into> into a civil war </ARG2-into> <ARGM-LOC> at some firms and organizations </ARGM-LOC> , <ARGM-ADV> causing internal contradictions and pitting employee against employee </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARGM-LOC> At Kidder , a unit of General Electric Co. , and other big brokerage firms </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> stockbrokers </ARG0> <battle.01>battle</battle.01> <ARG1> their own firm 's program traders a few floors away </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Corporations like Contel </ARG0> <denounce.01>denounce</denounce.01> <ARG1> program trading </ARG1> , yet Contel has in the past hired pension fund managers like Bankers Trust Co. that are also big program traders .
<ARG1> The Big Board -- the nation 's premier stock exchange -- </ARG1> is <ARGM-MNR> sharply </ARGM-MNR> <divide.02>divided</divide.02> <ARG2-between> between its floor traders and its top executives </ARG2-between> .
Its <entrench.01>entrenched</entrench.01> <ARG1> 49 stock specialists firms </ARG1> are fighting tooth and nail against programs .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> the Big Board 's leadership <ARGM-ADV> -- over the specialists ' protests -- </ARGM-ADV> <ARGM-TMP> two weeks ago </ARGM-TMP> <begin.01>began</begin.01> trading a new stock `` basket '' product designed to facilitate program trading .
`` <ARG0> A lot of people </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <like.02>like</like.02> <ARG1> to go back to 1970 , '' before program trading </ARG1> , Mr. Phelan said this week .
`` <ARG0> I </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <like.02>like</like.02> <ARG1> to go back to 1970 </ARG1> .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG1> we </ARG1> are <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> <go.01>going</go.01> back <ARG2-to> to 1970 </ARG2-to> . ''
<ARGM-TMP> Again and again </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> program-trading 's critics </ARG0> <raise.01>raise</raise.01> <ARG1> the `` casino '' theme </ARG1> .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> greedy market manipulators have made a shambles of the nation 's free-enterprise system , turning the stock market into a big gambling den , with the odds heavily stacked against the small investor .
`` <ARG1> The public </ARG1> did <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <come.01>come</come.01> <ARG4-to> to the market </ARG4-to> <ARGM-PNC> to play a game </ARGM-PNC> ; they can go to Off-Track Betting for that , '' says A. Brean Murray , chairman of Brean Murray , Foster Securities , a traditional money management firm .
<ARG0> The program traders </ARG0> , <ARGM-DIS> on the other hand </ARGM-DIS> , <portray.01>portray</portray.01> <ARG1> old-fashioned stock pickers </ARG1> <ARG2-as> as the Neanderthals of the industry </ARG2-as> .
<ARG0> Critics like Mr. Murray </ARG0> `` are <look.01>looking</look.01> <ARG1-for> for witches </ARG1-for> , and people who use computers to trade are a convenient boogieman , '' says J. Thomas Allen , president of Advanced Investment Management Inc. , a Pittsburgh firm that runs a $ 200 million fund that uses index arbitrage .
`` <ARG0> Just a blind fear of the unknown </ARG0> is <cause.01>causing</cause.01> <ARGM-PRD> them to beg the regulators for protection </ARGM-PRD> . ''
<ARGM-ADV> Like other forms of arbitrage </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> it </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> merely </ARGM-ADV> <seek.01>seeks</seek.01> <ARG1> to take advantage of momentary discrepancies in the price of a single product -- in this case , a basket of stocks -- in different markets -- in this case the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago futures markets </ARG1> .
That divergence is what <ARG0> stock index traders </ARG0> <seek.01>seek</seek.01> .
When <ARG1> it </ARG1> <occur.01>occurs</occur.01> , the traders place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks -LRB- such as the 500 stocks that constitute the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index -RRB- in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market ; they lock in the difference in price as profit .
Such program trades , which <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <involve.01>involve</involve.01> <ARG1> the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock </ARG1> , occur in a matter of seconds .
<ARG0> A program trade of $ 5 million of stock </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> typically </ARGM-ADV> <earn.01>earns</earn.01> <ARG1> a razor-thin profit of $ 25,000 </ARG1> .
To <keep.02>keep</keep.02> <ARG1> program-trading units profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage executives </ARG1> , <ARG0> traders </ARG0> must seize every opportunity their computers find .
<ARGM-MNR> The speed with which </ARGM-MNR> <ARG1> such program trades </ARG1> <take.14>take</take.14> <ARG2> place </ARG2> and the volatile price movements they can cause are what program trading critics profess to despise .
`` If <ARG0> you </ARG0> <continue.01>continue</continue.01> <ARG1> to do this </ARG1> , the investor becomes frightened -- any investor : the odd lotter , mutual funds and pension funds , '' says Larry Zicklin , managing partner at Neuberger & Berman .
But <ARG0> many experts and traders </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> <ARG1> that program trading is n't the main reason for stock-market gyrations </ARG1> .
`` <ARG0> I </ARG0> have <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> <see.01>seen</see.01> one iota of evidence '' to support restrictions on program trading , says a Vanderbilt University finance professor , Hans Stoll , an authority on the subject .
<say.01>Says</say.01> <ARG0> the Big Board 's Mr. Phelan </ARG0> , `` <ARG1> Volatility is greater than program trading </ARG1> . ''
<ARG1> The Oct. 13 plunge </ARG1> was <trigger.01>triggered</trigger.01> not by program traders , but <ARG0-by> by news of the unraveling of the $ 6.79 billion buy-out of UAL Corp </ARG0-by> .
Unable to <unload.01>unload</unload.01> <ARG1> UAL and other airline shares </ARG1> , <ARG0> takeover-stock speculators , or risk arbitragers , </ARG0> dumped every blue-chip stock they had .
While <ARG1> program trades </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> swiftly </ARGM-MNR> <kick.02>kicked</kick.02> in , a `` circuit breaker '' that halted trading in stock futures in Chicago made some program trading impossible .
<ARG0> Susan Del Signore , head trader at Travelers Investment Management Co. , </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> critics are ignoring `` the role the -LCB- takeover stock -RCB- speculator is taking in the market as a source of volatility . ''
Many arbs are `` overleveraged , '' <ARG0> she </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> , and they `` have to sell when things look like they fall apart . ''
<ARGM-ADV> Like virtually everything on Wall Street </ARGM-ADV> , the program-trading battle is over money , and <ARG0> the traditionalists </ARG0> have been <lose.06>losing</lose.06> out <ARG1-on> on bundles of it </ARG1-on> <ARG2-to> to the New Guard </ARG2-to> <ARGM-TMP> in recent years </ARGM-TMP> .
<take.01><ARG0></take.01> <ARG1> the traditional money managers , or `` stock pickers , '' as they are derisively known among the computer jockeys </ARG1> . </ARG0>
<ARG0> Traditional stock managers </ARG0> <like.02>like</like.02> to charge 50 cents to 75 cents for every $ 100 they manage for big institutional investors , and higher fees for smaller investors .
<ARGM-DIS> Yet </ARGM-DIS> <ARG1> many such managers </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> consistently </ARGM-ADV> <fail.01>fail</fail.01> <ARG2> to even keep up with , much less beat , the returns of standard benchmarks like the S&P </ARG2>
<ARGM-ADV> Not surprisingly </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> old-style money managers </ARG0> have been <lose.02>losing</lose.02> <ARG1> clients </ARG1> <ARG2-to> to giant stock-index funds that use computers to juggle portfolios so they mirror the S&P 500 </ARG2-to> .
<ARG0> The indexers </ARG0> <charge.01>charge</charge.01> <ARG1> only a few pennies per $ 100 managed </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> Today </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> about $ 200 billion , or 20 % of all pension-fund stock investments , </ARG1> is <hold.01>held</hold.01> <ARG0-by> by index funds </ARG0-by> .
The new Wall Street of computers and <automate.01>automated</automate.01> <ARG1> trading </ARG1> threatens to make dinosaurs of the 49 Big Board stock-specialist firms .
<ARG0> These small but influential floor brokers </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> long </ARGM-TMP> have <earn.01>earned</earn.01> <ARG1> fat returns of 30 % to 40 % a year </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> on their capital </ARGM-MNR> , <ARGM-ADV> by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> The specialists </ARG0> <see.01>see</see.01> <ARG1> any step to electronic trading as a death knell </ARG1> .
<ARGM-DIS> And </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> they </ARG0> <believe.01>believe</believe.01> the Big Board , under Mr. Phelan , has abandoned their interest .
<ARGM-ADV> The son of a specialist and once one himself </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> Mr. Phelan </ARG0> has <ARGM-DIS> nonetheless </ARGM-DIS> been <strive.01>striving</strive.01> <ARGM-ADV> -- with products like the new stock basket that his former colleagues dislike so much -- </ARGM-ADV> <ARG1> to keep index funds and other program traders from taking their business to overseas markets </ARG1> .
<ARGM-DIS> Meanwhile </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG1> specialists ' trading risks </ARG1> have <skyrocket.01>skyrocketed</skyrocket.01> <ARGM-CAU> as a result of stock-market volatility </ARGM-CAU> .
`` When <ARG0> the sell programs </ARG0> <hit.02>hit</hit.02> , you can hear the order printers start to go '' on the Big Board trading floor , says one specialist there .
`` <ARG0> The buyers </ARG0> <walk.01>walk</walk.01> <ARGM-DIR> away </ARGM-DIR> , and the specialist is left alone '' as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks , he contends .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> are <ARGM-TMP> still </ARGM-TMP> <try.01>trying</try.01> <ARG1> to lure back small investors spooked by the 1987 stock-market crash and the market 's swings since then </ARG1> .
`` Small investors are absolutely dismayed that <ARG0> Wall Street </ARG0> is <stack.01>stacking</stack.01> <ARG1> the deck </ARG1> <ARG2-against> against them </ARG2-against> , and these wide swings are scaring them to death , '' says Raymond A. Mason , chairman of regional broker Legg Mason Inc. in Baltimore .
<ARG1> Stockbrokers ' business and pay </ARG1> has been <fall.01>falling</fall.01> .
<ARGM-TMP> Last year </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> the average broker </ARG0> <earn.01>earned</earn.01> <ARG1> $ 71,309 , 24 % lower than in 1987 </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Corporate executives </ARG0> <resent.01>resent</resent.01> <ARG1> that their company 's stock has been transformed into a nameless piece of a stock-index basket </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Index traders who </ARG0> <buy.01>buy</buy.01> <ARG1> all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 </ARG1> often do n't even know what the companies they own actually do , complains Andrew Sigler , chairman of Champion International Corp .
`` Do <ARG0> you </ARG0> <make.01>make</make.01> <ARG1> sweatshirts or sparkplugs </ARG1> ?
Oh , you 're in the paper business , '' is one reaction <ARG0> Mr. Sigler </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> he 's gotten from his big institutional shareholders .
<ARGM-TMP> By this September </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> program traders </ARG0> were <do.02>doing</do.02> <ARG1> a record 13.8 % of the Big Board 's average daily trading volume </ARG1> .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARGM-TMP> then </ARGM-TMP> <come.01>came</come.01> <ARG1> Oct. 13 and the negative publicity orchestrated by the Old Guard , particularly against index arbitrage </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The indexers ' strategy for the moment </ARG0> is to hunker down and <let.01>let</let.01> <ARG1> the furor die </ARG1> .
`` <ARG1> There 's a lynch-mob psychology right now </ARG1> , '' <say.01>says</say.01> <ARG0> the top program-trading official at a Wall Street firm </ARG0> .
`` <ARG1> Wall Street 's cash cow </ARG1> has been <gore.01>gored</gore.01> , but I do n't think anyone has proven that index arbitrage is the problem . ''
Too much money is at stake for <ARG0> program traders </ARG0> to <give.07>give</give.07> up .
<ARGM-DIS> For example </ARGM-DIS> , stock-index futures <begin.01>began</begin.01> trading in Chicago in 1982 , and within two years they were the fastest-growing futures contract ever launched .
<ARG0> Stock futures trading </ARG0> has <mint.01>minted</mint.01> <ARG1> dozens of millionaires in their 20s and 30s </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> Now </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-TMP> on a good day </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Chicago 's stock-index traders </ARG0> <trade.01>trade</trade.01> <ARG1> more dollars worth of stock futures than the Big Board trades in stock </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> Now </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> the stage </ARG1> is <set.02>set</set.02> <ARGM-PNC> for the battle to play out </ARGM-PNC> .
<ARG0> The anti-programmers </ARG0> are <get.01>getting</get.01> <ARG1> some helpful thunder </ARG1> <ARG2-from> from Congress </ARG2-from> .
<ARG0> Program traders ' </ARG0> `` power to <create.01>create</create.01> <ARG1> total panic </ARG1> is so great that they ca n't be allowed to have their way , '' says Rep. Edward Markey , a Massachusetts Democrat .
`` We <have.02>have</have.02> to have a system that says to those largest investors :
<ARG1> ` <sit.02>Sit</sit.02> down ! </ARG1>
<ARG1> You </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> <panic.01>panic</panic.01> ,
<ARG0> you </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> <put.01>put</put.01> <ARG1> the financial system </ARG1> <ARG2-in> in jeopardy </ARG2-in> . ' ''
But the prospects for <ARG0> legislation that </ARG0> <target.01>targets</target.01> <ARG1> program trading </ARG1> is unlikely anytime soon .
<ARG2> Many people </ARG2> , <include.01>including</include.01> <ARG1> the Big Board </ARG1> , think that it 's too late to put the genie back in the bottle .
<ARG0> The Big Board 's directors </ARG0> <meet.03>meet</meet.03> <ARGM-TMP> today </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-PNC> to approve some program-trading restrictions </ARGM-PNC> , but a total ban is n't being considered , Big Board officials say .
`` You 're <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> <go.04>going</go.04> to stop the idea of trading a basket of stocks , '' says Vanderbilt 's Prof. Stoll . ``
<ARG1> Program trading </ARG1> is here to <stay.01>stay</stay.01> , and computers are here to stay , and we just need to understand it . ''
<ARGM-ADV> Short of a total ban </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> some anti-programmers </ARG0> have <propose.01>proposed</propose.01> several middle-ground reforms , which they say would take away certain advantages program traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors do n't .
One such proposal regarding stock-index futures is an increase in the margin requirement -- or <ARG1> the `` good-faith '' payment of cash </ARG1> <need.01>needed</need.01> <ARGM-PNC> to trade them </ARGM-PNC> -- to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks .
<ARG0> Currently , margins on stock futures purchases are much lower -- roughly 7 % compared with 50 % for stocks -- <make.02>making</make.02> <ARG1> the futures market </ARG1> <ARG2> much faster and potentially more speculative </ARG2> . </ARG0>
<ARG0> Program trading critics </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <want.01>want</want.01> <ARG1> the Federal Reserve Board , rather than the futures industry , to set such margins </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Futures traders </ARG0> <respond.01>respond</respond.01> <ARG2> that low margins help keep their markets active </ARG2> .
<ARG0> Higher margins </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <chase.01>chase</chase.01> <ARGM-DIR> away </ARGM-DIR> <ARG1> dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell </ARG1> , they say .
Another <propose.01>proposed</propose.01> <ARG1> reform </ARG1> is to have program traders answer to an `` uptick rule '' a reform instituted after the Great Crash of 1929 that protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices , namely short sellers .
<ARG3> The Big Board 's uptick rule </ARG3> <prevent.01>prevents</prevent.01> <ARG1> the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price </ARG1> .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARGM-TMP> in 1986 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> program traders </ARG0> <receive.01>received</receive.01> <ARG1> what amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations </ARG1> , <ARGM-PNC> to make it easier to link the stock and futures markets </ARGM-PNC> .
<ARG0> A reinstatement of the uptick rule for program traders </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <slow.01>slow</slow.01> <ARG1> their activity </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> considerably </ARGM-MNR> .
<ARG0> Program traders </ARG0> <argue.01>argue</argue.01> <ARG1> that a reinstatement of the rule would destroy the `` pricing efficiency '' of the futures and stock markets </ARG1> .
<ARG0> James A. White </ARG0> <contribute.01>contributed</contribute.01> <ARG2-to> to this article </ARG2-to> .
<ARG0> Big Board Chairman John Phelan </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARGM-TMP> yesterday </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> that he could support letting federal regulators suspend program trading during wild stock-price swings </ARG1> .
<ARGM-DIS> Thus </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> the band-wagon psychology of recent days </ARG0> <pick.04>picks</pick.04> up <ARG1> new impetus </ARG1> .
As <ARGM-TMP> usually </ARGM-TMP> <practice.01>practiced</practice.01> <ARG1> it </ARG1> takes advantage of a rather basic concept : Two separate markets in different locations , trading basically the same widgets , ca n't trade them for long at prices that are widely different .
In index arbitrage , the widget is the S&P 500 , and <ARG1> its price </ARG1> is <ARGM-TMP> constantly </ARGM-TMP> <compare.01>compared</compare.01> <ARGM-LOC> between the futures market in Chicago and the stock markets largely in New York </ARGM-LOC> .
To <profit.01>profit</profit.01> <ARG1-from> from an index-arbitrage opportunity </ARG1-from> , <ARG0> someone who owns the S&P 500 widget in New York </ARG0> must sell it and replace it with a cheaper S&P 500 widget in Chicago .
If <ARG0> the money manager </ARG0> <perform.01>performing</perform.01> <ARG1> this service </ARG1> is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the S&P 500 index , he is likely to remain fully invested at all times .
-LRB- <ARG0> Few , if any , index-fund managers </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <risk.01>risk</risk.01> <ARG1> leveraging performance </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> by owning more than 100 % exposure to stocks </ARGM-MNR> , and equally few will want to own less than a 100 % position should stocks rise . -RRB-
By <ARGM-TMP> constantly </ARGM-TMP> <seek.01>seeking</seek.01> <ARG1> to own the cheapest widget </ARG1> , <ARG0> index-arbitrage traders </ARG0> hope to add between 1 % and 3 % to the annual return of the S&P 500 .
<ARG0> That </ARG0> <represent.01>represents</represent.01> <ARG1> a very thin `` excess '' return , certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim to seek as their performance objective </ARG1> .
The fact that <ARG1> a vast majority of fundamentalist money managers </ARG1> <fail.01>fail</fail.01> <ARG2> to beat the S&P 500 </ARG2> may contribute to the hysteria surrounding the issue .
As <ARG0> more managers </ARG0> <pursue.01>pursue</pursue.01> <ARG1> the index-arbitrage strategy </ARG1> , these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and , eventually , eliminated .
<ARG1> The current opportunities </ARG1> <arise.01>arise</arise.01> <ARGM-CAU> because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the S&P 500 is more cumbersome than transacting in the futures market </ARGM-CAU> .
<ARG0> The New York Stock Exchange 's </ARG0> attempt to <introduce.02>introduce</introduce.02> <ARG1> a new portfolio basket </ARG1> is evidence of investors ' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares .
So if <ARG0> index arbitrage </ARG0> is simply <take.01>taking</take.01> <ARG1> advantage </ARG1> <ARG2-of> of thin inefficiencies between two markets for the same widget </ARG2-of> , how did `` program trading '' evolve into the evil creature that is evoking the curses of so many observers ?
All arguments against program trading , <ARG1> even those </ARG1> <press.01>pressed</press.01> <ARGM-MNR> without fact </ARGM-MNR> , conclude with three expected results after `` reforms '' are implemented : 1 -RRB- reduced volatility , 2 -RRB- a long-term investment focus , and 3 -RRB- a level playing field for the small investor .
<reduce.01><ARG0></reduce.01> <ARG1> volatility </ARG1> . </ARG0>
<ARG1> An index-arbitrage trade </ARG1> is <ARGM-TMP> never </ARGM-TMP> <execute.02>executed</execute.02> unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in New York and Chicago to cover all transaction costs .
<ARG0> Arbitrage </ARG0> does <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <cause.01>cause</cause.01> <ARG1> volatility </ARG1> ; it responds to it .
<think.01><ARG0></think.01> <ARG2-about> about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for S&P 500 stocks </ARG2-about> -- usually it is large investors initiating a buy or sell in Chicago . </ARG0>
<ARG0> A large investor </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-ADV> likely </ARGM-ADV> <cause.01>cause</cause.01> <ARG1> the futures market to decline </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> when he sells his futures </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> Arbitrage </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> simply </ARGM-DIS> <transfer.01>transfers</transfer.01> <ARG1> his selling pressure </ARG1> <ARG3-from> from Chicago </ARG3-from> <ARG2-to> to New York </ARG2-to> , <ARGM-ADV> while functioning as a buyer in Chicago </ARGM-ADV> .
The start of the whole process is the key - <ARG0> someone </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> must </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-MNR> fundamentally </ARGM-MNR> <increase.01>increase</increase.01> or decrease <ARG1> his ownership in widgets </ARG1> <ARGM-PNC> to make widget prices move </ARGM-PNC> .
<ARGM-CAU> Why </ARGM-CAU> does <ARG0> this large hypothetical seller </ARG0> <trade.01>trade</trade.01> <ARGM-LOC> in Chicago instead of New York </ARGM-LOC> ?
Perhaps <ARG0> he </ARG0> is willing to <sacrifice.01>sacrifice</sacrifice.01> <ARG2-to> to the arbitrage trader </ARG2-to> <ARG1> some small profit </ARG1> in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade .
<ARGM-TMP> In a competitive market </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> this investor </ARG0> <have.03>has</have.03> many ways to execute his transactions , and he will have more alternatives -LRB- both foreign and domestic -RRB- if his volume is profitable for an exchange to handle .
<ARG1> Volatility </ARG1> <surround.01>surrounding</surround.01> <ARG2> his trades </ARG2> occurs not because of index arbitrage , but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a widget market with finite liquidity .
<eliminate.01><ARG0></eliminate.01> <ARG1> arbitrage </ARG1> and liquidity will decline instead of rising , creating more volatility instead of less . </ARG0>
<ARG1> The speed of his transaction </ARG1> is n't to be <fear.01>feared</fear.01> <ARGM-DIS> either </ARGM-DIS> , because faster and cleaner execution is desirable , not loathsome .
If <slow.03>slowing</slow.03> <ARG1> things </ARG1> down could reduce volatility , <ARG0> stone tablets </ARG0> should become the trade ticket of the future .
<encourage.02><ARG0></encourage.02> <ARG1> long-term investing </ARG1> . </ARG0>
<ARG0> We </ARG0> must be very cautious about <label.01>labeling</label.01> <ARG1> investors </ARG1> <ARG2-as> as `` long-term '' or `` short-term </ARG2-as> . ''
<ARG1> Policies </ARG1> <design.01>designed</design.01> <ARGM-PNC> to encourage one type of investor over another </ARGM-PNC> are akin to placing a sign over the Big Board 's door saying : `` Buyers welcome , sellers please go away ! ''
The ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive , and <ARG0> regulators </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> should </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> <concern.01>concern</concern.01> <ARG1-REC> themselves </ARG1-REC> <ARG2-with> with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term </ARG2-with> .
<ARG0> A free market with a profit motive </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <attract.01>attract</attract.01> <ARG1> each investor </ARG1> to the liquidity and risks he can tolerate .
In point of fact , <ARG1> volatility </ARG1> as <measure.01>measured</measure.01> <ARG2-by> by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements </ARG2-by> has frequently been much higher than it is today .
Periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile , usually when <ARG1> fundamental market conditions </ARG1> were <undergo.01>undergoing</undergo.01> <ARG2> change </ARG2> -LRB- 1973-75 , 1937-40 , and 1928-33 for example -RRB- .
<ARG0> It is interesting to <see.01>see</see.01> <ARG1> the fundamental stock pickers scream `` foul '' on program trading when the markets decline , while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise </ARG1> . </ARG0>
Could <rise.01>rising</rise.01> <ARG1> volatility </ARG1> possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks , instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins ?
Some of the <propose.01>proposed</propose.01> <ARG1> fixes </ARG1> for what is labeled `` program-trading volatility '' could be far worse than the perceived problem .
In <use.01>using</use.01> <ARG1> program trading </ARG1> <ARG2-as> as a whipping boy </ARG2-as> , <ARG0> fundamentalist investors </ARG0> stand to gain the high ground in wooing small investors for their existing stock-selection products .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> may </ARGM-MOD> , <ARGM-DIS> however </ARGM-DIS> , <risk.01>risk</risk.01> <ARG1> bringing some damaging interference from outside the markets </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> themselves </ARGM-ADV> .
How does a nice new tax , <say.01>say</say.01> <ARG1> 5 % </ARG1> , on any financial transaction sound ?
<ARG0> That </ARG0> ought to <make.04>make</make.04> <ARG1> sure </ARG1> we 're all thinking for the long term .
<get.01><ARG0></get.01> <ARG1> a level playing field </ARG1> . </ARG0>
<ARG0> This argument is perhaps the most interesting one for <abolish.01>abolishing</abolish.01> <ARG1> program trading </ARG1> -- not because of its merits , but because of the firms championing the cause . </ARG0>
The loudest of these reformers are <ARG0> money managers who </ARG0> <cater.01>cater</cater.01> <ARG2-to> to smaller investors </ARG2-to> .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> continually </ARGM-TMP> <advise.01>advise</advise.01> <ARG1> their clients </ARG1> <ARG2-on> on which individual stocks to buy or sell </ARG2-on> , <ARGM-ADV> while their clients continue to hope for superior performance </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARGM-MNR> Even with mutual funds </ARGM-MNR> , <ARG0> the little investor </ARG0> <continue.01>continues</continue.01> <ARG1> to tolerate high fees , high commissions and poor performance </ARG1> , <ARGM-ADV> while index-fund managers slowly amass a better record with lower fees , lower commissions and less risk </ARGM-ADV> .
Yet our efforts are somehow less noble than those of <ARG0> an investment expert </ARG0> <ARGM-MNR> studiously </ARGM-MNR> <devour.01>devouring</devour.01> press clippings on each company he follows .
<ARG1> Almost all new regulation </ARG1> is <introduce.02>introduced</introduce.02> <ARGM-MNR> in the interests of protecting the little guy </ARGM-MNR> , and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences .
<ARGM-ADV> If spreads available from index arbitrage are so enormous </ARGM-ADV> , <ARGM-DIS> surely </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> any sizable mutual-fund company </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <profit.01>profit</profit.01> <ARG1-from> from offering it to small investors </ARG1-from> .
The sad reality is that <ARG0> the retail investor </ARG0> <continue.01>continues</continue.01> <ARG1> to pursue stellar performers first , while leaving institutions to grapple with basis points of performance on large sums of money quarter by quarter </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Cost-effective index funds </ARG0> just are n't sexy enough to <justify.01>justify</justify.01> <ARG1> the high fees and commissions that retail customers frequently pay , and that institutional customers refuse to pay </ARG1> .
<ARG1> Each new trading roadblock </ARG1> is likely to be <beat.03>beaten</beat.03> by institutions seeking better ways to serve their high-volume clients , here or overseas .
<legislate.01><ARG0></legislate.01> <ARG1> new trading inefficiencies </ARG1> will only make things harder on the least sophisticated investors . </ARG0>
<leave.02>Left</leave.02> <ARG2-to> to its own devices </ARG2-to> , <ARG1> index arbitrage </ARG1> will become more and more efficient , making it harder and harder to do profitably .
<ARG1> Spreads </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <become.01>become</become.01> <ARG2> so tight that it wo n't matter which market an investor chooses </ARG2> -- arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit .
If <ARG0> government or private watchdogs </ARG0> <insist.01>insist</insist.01> , <ARGM-DIS> however </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG1-on> on introducing greater friction between the markets -LRB- limits on price moves , two-tiered execution , higher margin requirements , taxation , etc. -RRB- </ARG1-on> , the end loser will be the markets themselves .
<ARGM-DIS> Instead </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> we </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> ought </ARGM-MOD> to be <invite.01>inviting</invite.01> <ARG1> more liquidity </ARG1> with cheaper ways to trade and transfer capital among all participants .

<ARG0> Some Democrats in Congress </ARG0> are <warn.01>warning</warn.01> <ARG1> that a complicated new funding device for the two federal antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in recent years </ARG1> .
The funding mechanism , which has <receive.01>received</receive.01> <ARG1> congressional approval </ARG1> and is expected to be signed by President Bush , would affect the antitrust operations of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission .
As a part of overall efforts to <reduce.01>reduce</reduce.01> <ARG1> spending </ARG1> , <ARG0> Congress </ARG0> cut by $ 30 million the Bush administration 's request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 , which began Oct. 1 .
To <offset.01>offset</offset.01> <ARG1> the reduction </ARG1> , <ARG0> Congress </ARG0> approved a $ 20,000 fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers , acquisitions and certain other transactions .
<ARG1> Some Democrats </ARG1> , <lead.02>led</lead.02> <ARG0-by> by Rep. Jack Brooks -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- </ARG0-by> , unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts .
But <ARG0> Justice Department and FTC officials </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them .
`` <ARG1> It </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <operate.01>operate</operate.01> <ARGM-PNC> to augment our budget </ARGM-PNC> , '' James Rill , the Justice Department 's antitrust chief , said in an interview .
Under <ARG1> measures </ARG1> <approve.01>approved</approve.01> <ARG0-by> by both houses of Congress </ARG0-by> , the administration 's request for $ 47 million for the Antitrust Division would be cut $ 15 million .
The FTC budget request of $ 70 million , <ARG1> about $ 34 million of which </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <go.XX>go</go.XX> <ARGM-PNC> for antitrust enforcement </ARGM-PNC> , would also be cut by $ 15 million .
<ARG0> The administration </ARG0> had <request.01>requested</request.01> <ARG1> roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 as was appropriated in fiscal 1989 </ARG1> .
The <offset.01>offsetting</offset.01> <ARG2> fees </ARG2> would apply to filings made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act .
Under that law , <ARG0> parties </ARG0> <propose.01>proposing</propose.01> <ARG1> mergers or acquisitions valued at $ 15 million or more </ARG1> must notify FTC and Justice Department antitrust regulators before completing the transactions .
<ARGM-TMP> Currently </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> the government </ARG0> <charge.01>charges</charge.01> <ARG1> nothing </ARG1> <ARG3-for> for such filings </ARG3-for> .
<ARG0> Proponents of the funding arrangement </ARG0> <predict.01>predict</predict.01> <ARG1> that , based on recent filing levels of more than 2,000 a year , the fees will yield at least $ 40 million this fiscal year , or $ 10 million more than the budget cuts </ARG1> .
`` <ARGM-TMP> When </ARGM-TMP> <ARG0> you </ARG0> <do.02>do</do.02> <ARG1> that </ARG1> , there is not a cut , but there is in fact a program increase of $ 5 million '' each for the FTC and the Justice Department , Rep. Neal Smith -LRB- D. , Iowa -RRB- said during House debate .
But <ARG0> Rep. Don Edwards -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- </ARG0> <respond.01>responded</respond.01> <ARG2> that a recession could stifle merger activity , reducing the amount of fees collected </ARG2> .
<ARG1> The antitrust staffs of both the FTC and Justice Department </ARG1> were <cut.02>cut</cut.02> <ARG2-EXT> more than 40 % </ARG2-EXT> <ARGM-TMP> in the Reagan administration </ARGM-TMP> , and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period .
<ARG0> `` Today is not the time to <signal.01>signal</signal.01> <ARG1> that Congress in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen </ARG1> , '' Mr. Edwards argued . </ARG0>
<ARG1> Any money </ARG1> in excess of $ 40 million <collect.01>collected</collect.01> <ARG2-from> from the fees </ARG2-from> <ARGM-TMP> in fiscal 1990 </ARGM-TMP> would go to the Treasury at large .
<ARG0> Corporate lawyers </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the new fees would n't inhibit many mergers or other transactions .
Though <ARG0> some lawyers </ARG0> <report.01>reported</report.01> <ARG1> that prospective acquirers were scrambling to make filings before the fees take effect </ARG1> , government officials said they had n't noticed any surge in filings .

<ARG0> Researchers at American Telephone & Telegraph Co. 's Bell Laboratories </ARG0> <report.01>reported</report.01> they raised the electrical current-carrying capacity of new superconductor crystals by a factor of 100 , moving the materials closer to commercial use .
<ARG0> The scientists </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> they created small changes in the crystal-lattice structures of the superconductors to raise the amount of current that single crystals could carry to 600,000 amps per square centimeter in a moderately strong magnetic field .
<ARG0> The scientists </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> they made the advance with yttrium-containing superconductors cooled to liquid-nitrogen temperature , or minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit .
<ARG1> Their report </ARG1> <appear.01>appears</appear.01> <ARGM-LOC> in today 's issue of the journal Nature </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG0> The finding </ARG0> <mark.01>marks</mark.01> <ARG1> a significant step in research on `` bulk '' superconductors , which are aimed at use in wires for motors , magnets , generators and other applications </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Scientists </ARG0> had <obtain.01>obtained</obtain.01> <ARG1> even higher current-carrying capacity </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> in thin films of the new superconductors </ARGM-LOC> , but have had problems increasing the amount of current that bulk crystals could carry .

<ARG0> The AT&T advance </ARG0> <show.01>shows</show.01> <ARG1> how one aspect of the current-carrying problem can be overcome </ARG1> .

<ARG0> He </ARG0> <add.01>added</add.01> <ARG1> that the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of so-called weak links between crystals </ARG1> .
<ARG1> Such multi-crystal materials </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-ADV> probably </ARGM-ADV> be <need.01>needed</need.01> <ARGM-PNC> for commercial applications </ARGM-PNC> .
<ARG0> Mr. van Dover </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the AT&T team created the desired crystal changes by bombarding superconductor samples with neutrons , a process that creates some radioactivity in the samples and may not be feasible for large-scale commercial use .
<ARGM-TMP> Still </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> scientists </ARG0> <breathe.01>breathed</breathe.01> <ARG1> a collective sigh of relief </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> about the finding </ARGM-MNR> , <ARGM-CAU> because it demonstrates how to overcome the `` flux pinning '' problem that earlier this year was widely publicized as undercutting new superconductors ' potential </ARGM-CAU> .
<ARG2> The problem </ARG2> <involve.01>involves</involve.01> <ARG1> the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals </ARG1> , <ARGM-ADV> limiting their current-carrying capacity </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> Mr. van Dover </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the crystal changes his team introduced apparently pins the magnetic fields in place , preventing them from lowering current-carrying capacity .
<ARG0> Mr. van Dover </ARG0> <add.01>added</add.01> <ARG1> that researchers are trying to determine precisely what crystal changes solved the problem </ARG1> .
<determine.01><ARG0></determine.01> <ARG1> that </ARG1> may enable them to develop better ways to introduce the needed crystal-lattice patterns . </ARG0>

Although <ARG0> his team </ARG0> <lose.03>lost</lose.03> <ARG1> the World Series </ARG1> , San Francisco Giants owner Bob Lurie hopes to have a new home for them .
<ARG0> He is an avid fan of a proposition on next week 's ballot to <help.01>help</help.01> <ARG1> build a replacement for Candlestick Park </ARG1> . </ARG0>
Small wonder , since <ARG0> he </ARG0> 's <ask.02>asking</ask.02> <ARG2> San Francisco taxpayers </ARG2> <ARG1> to sink up to $ 100 million into the new stadium </ARG1> .
As <ARG0> San Francisco </ARG0> <dig.03>digs</dig.03> out <ARGM-DIR> from The Pretty Big One </ARGM-DIR> , opponents say the last thing the city can afford is an expensive new stadium .
<ARG1> A stadium craze </ARG1> is <sweep.02>sweeping</sweep.02> <ARG2> the country </ARG2> .
<ARG1> It </ARG1> 's <fuel.01>fueled</fuel.01> <ARG2-by> by the increasing profitability of major-league teams </ARG2-by> .
Something like one-third of the nation 's 60 largest cities are <think.01>thinking</think.01> <ARG2-about> about new stadiums </ARG2-about> , ranging from Cleveland to San Antonio and St. Petersburg .
<ARG0> Most boosters </ARG0> <claim.01>claim</claim.01> the new sports complexes will be moneymakers for their city .
<ARG0> Pepperdine University economist Dean Baim </ARG0> <scoff.01>scoffs</scoff.01> <ARG1-at> at that </ARG1-at> .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> has <look.01>looked</look.01> <ARG1-at> at 14 baseball and football stadiums </ARG1-at> and found that only one -- private Dodger Stadium -- brought more money into a city than it took out .
<ARG1> Stadiums </ARG1> <tend.02>tend</tend.02> <ARG2> to redistribute existing wealth within a community , not create more of it </ARG2> .
<ARG0> Voters </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> generally </ARGM-ADV> <agree.01>agree</agree.01> <ARGM-TMP> when they are given a chance to decide if they want to sink their own tax dollars into a new mega-stadium </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> San Francisco voters </ARG0> <reject.01>rejected</reject.01> <ARG1> a new ballpark </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> two years ago </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARGM-TMP> Last month </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Phoenix voters </ARG0> <turn.03>turned</turn.03> <ARG1> thumbs </ARG1> <ARGM-DIR> down </ARGM-DIR> <ARG2-on> on a $ 100 million stadium bond and tax proposition </ARG2-on> .
<ARG0> Its backers </ARG0> <field.01>fielded</field.01> <ARG1> every important interest on their team -- a popular mayor , the Chamber of Commerce , the major media -- </ARG1> and spent $ 100,000 on promotion .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> voters </ARG0> <decide.01>decided</decide.01> <ARG1> that if the stadium was such a good idea someone would build it himself </ARG1> , and rejected it 59 % to 41 % .
<ARGM-LOC> In San Francisco </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> its backers </ARG0> <concede.01>concede</concede.01> the ballpark is at best running even in the polls .
George Christopher , <ARG0> the former San Francisco mayor who </ARG0> <build.01>built</build.01> <ARG1> Candlestick Park </ARG1> <ARGM-PNC> for the Giants </ARGM-PNC> <ARGM-TMP> in the 1960s </ARGM-TMP> , wo n't endorse the new ballpark .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> he had Candlestick built because the Giants claimed they needed 10,000 parking spaces .
Since <ARG0> the new park </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <have.03>have</have.03> <ARG1> only 1,500 spaces </ARG1> , Mr. Christopher thinks backers are playing some fiscal `` games '' of their own with the voters .
<ARG0> Stadium boosters </ARG0> <claim.01>claim</claim.01> <ARG1> that without public money they would never be built </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie </ARG0> <disagree.01>disagrees</disagree.01> , and he can prove it .
<ARGM-TMP> Several years ago </ARGM-TMP> <ARG0> he </ARG0> <give.07>gave</give.07> up <ARG1> trying to persuade Miami to improve its city-owned Orange Bowl </ARG1> , and instead built his own $ 100 million coliseum with private funds .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> did <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <see.01>see</see.01> why the taxpayers should help build something he would then use to turn a healthy profit .
`` <ARG0> This stadium </ARG0> <show.01>shows</show.01> that anything government can do , we can do better , '' Mr. Robbie says .
But to Moon Landrieu , <ARG0> the former New Orleans mayor who </ARG0> <help.01>helped</help.01> <ARG1> build that city 's cavernous , money-losing Superdome </ARG1> , questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance .
`` <ARG1> The Superdome is an exercise in optimism , a statement of faith </ARG1> , '' <ARG0> he </ARG0> has <say.01>said</say.01> .
`` It is the very building of it that is important , not <ARG1> how much of it </ARG1> is <use.01>used</use.01> or its economics . ''
<ARG0> An Egyptian Pharaoh </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> have <justify.01>justified</justify.01> <ARG1> his pyramids </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> any better </ARGM-MNR> .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG1> civilization </ARG1> has <move.01>moved</move.01> <ARG2-DIR> forward </ARG2-DIR> <ARGM-TMP> since then </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARGM-TMP> Today </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> taxpayers </ARG1> <get.XX>get</get.XX> <ARG2> to vote , most of the time , on whether they want to finance the building schemes of our modern political pharaohs , or let private money erect these playgrounds for public passions </ARG2> .

<ARG0> Wall Street 's big securities firms </ARG0> <face.01>face</face.01> <ARG1> the prospect of having their credit ratings lowered </ARG1> .
The reason : <ARG1> Risks from the firms ' new `` merchant banking '' activities </ARG1> are <rise.01>rising</rise.01> <ARGM-ADV> as revenue from the industry 's traditional business erodes </ARGM-ADV> .
The downgrading of <ARG1> debt </ARG1> <issue.01>issued</issue.01> <ARG0-by> by CS First Boston Inc. , parent of First Boston Corp. , </ARG0-by> by Moody 's Investors Service Inc. , coupled with a Moody 's announcement that Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. is under review for a possible downgrade , sent shivers through the brokerage community this week .
<ARGM-ADV> With the shudders </ARGM-ADV> <come.01>came</come.01> <ARG1> the realization that some of Wall Street 's biggest players are struggling to maintain the stellar credit standing required to finance their activities profitably </ARG1> .
Securities firms are among the biggest issuers of <ARG1> commercial paper , or short-term corporate IOUs , which </ARG1> <ARG0> they </ARG0> <sell.01>sell</sell.01> <ARGM-PNC> to finance their daily operations </ARGM-PNC> .
<ARG0> The biggest firms </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> still </ARGM-TMP> <retain.01>retain</retain.01> <ARG1> the highest ratings on their commercial paper </ARG1> .
But <ARG0> Moody 's </ARG0> <warn.01>warned</warn.01> <ARG1> that Shearson 's commercial paper rating could be lowered soon , a move that would reduce Shearson 's profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms </ARG1> .
`` Just as <ARG0> the 1980s bull market </ARG0> <transform.01>transformed</transform.01> <ARG1> the U.S. securities business </ARG1> , so too will the more difficult environment of the 1990s , '' says Christopher T. Mahoney , a Moody 's vice president .
<ARG0> Standard & Poor 's Corp. </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> First Boston , Shearson and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , in particular , are likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in months ahead .
<ARG0> What </ARG0> <worry.01>worries</worry.01> <ARG1> credit-rating concerns </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> the most </ARGM-MNR> is that Wall Street firms are taking long-term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy-out and junk bond financings .
<ARG0> That 's a departure from their traditional practice of <transfer.01>transferring</transfer.01> <ARG1> almost all financing risks </ARG1> <ARG2-to> to investors </ARG2-to> . </ARG0>
Whereas <ARG1> conventional securities financings </ARG1> are <structure.01>structured</structure.01> <ARG2> to be sold quickly </ARG2> , Wall Street 's new penchant for leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds is resulting in long-term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years .
`` <ARG0> The recent disarray in the junk bond market </ARG0> <suggest.01>suggests</suggest.01> <ARG1> that brokers may become longer-term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays '' in getting their money back </ARG1> , says Jeffrey Bowman , a vice president at S&P , which raised a warning flag for the industry in April when it downgraded CS First Boston .
`` <ARG0> Wall Street </ARG0> is <face.01>facing</face.01> <ARG1> a Catch-22 situation </ARG1> , '' says Mr. Mahoney of Moody 's .
Merchant banking , where <ARG0> firms </ARG0> <commit.01>commit</commit.01> <ARG1> their own money </ARG1> , `` is getting riskier , and there 's less of it to go around . ''
In addition , <ARG0> he </ARG0> <say.01>says</say.01> , the buy-out business is under pressure `` because of the junk bond collapse , '' meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk-bond financings shrinks .
<ARGM-LOC> In a leveraged buy-out </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> a small group of investors </ARG0> <acquire.01>acquires</acquire.01> <ARG1> a company </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> in a transaction financed largely by borrowing </ARGM-MNR> , <ARGM-MNR> with the expectation that the debt will be paid with funds generated by the acquired company 's operations or sales of its assets </ARGM-MNR> .
<ARGM-LOC> In a recent report </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> Moody 's </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it `` expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry , which , combined with overcapacity , will create poor prospects for profitability . ''
<ARG0> It </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that the `` temptation for managements to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor </ARG1> . ''
<ARG0> Both Moody 's and S&P </ARG0> <cite.01>cited</cite.01> <ARG1> First Boston 's reliance in recent years on merchant banking , which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm 's profit </ARG1> .
The recent cash squeeze at Campeau Corp. , First Boston 's most lucrative client of the decade , is <prove.01>proving</prove.01> costly to First Boston <ARGM-CAU> because it arranged more than $ 3 billion of high-yield , high-risk junk financings for Campeau units </ARGM-CAU> .
In addition , <ARG1> a big loan that </ARG1> <ARG0> First Boston </ARG0> <make.03>made</make.03> <ARG2-to> to Ohio Mattress Co . </ARG2-to> was n't repaid on time when its $ 450 million junk financing for a buy-out of the bedding company was withdrawn .
`` <ARG0> These two exposures alone </ARG0> <represent.01>represent</represent.01> <ARG1> a very substantial portion of CS First Boston 's equity </ARG1> , '' Moody 's said .
<ARG1> CS First Boston </ARG1> , <ARGM-DIS> however </ARGM-DIS> , <benefit.01>benefits</benefit.01> <ARG0-from> from the backing of its largest shareholder , Credit Suisse , Switzerland 's third largest bank </ARG0-from> .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG1> its earnings </ARG1> <become.01>became</become.01> <ARG2> a major disappointment </ARG2> <ARGM-ADV> as its traditional retail , or individual investor , business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the October 1987 stock market crash </ARGM-ADV> .
In addition , Shearson 's <list.02>listed</list.02> <ARG1> $ 2 billion </ARG1> of capital is overstated , according to the rating concerns , because it includes $ 1.7 billion of goodwill .
<ARG0> Shearson </ARG0> `` <ARGM-ADV> really </ARGM-ADV> <ARGM-ADV> only </ARGM-ADV> <have.03>has</have.03> <ARG1> $ 300 million of capital </ARG1> , '' says Mr. Bowman of S&P .
<ARG0> A Shearson spokesman </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the firm is n't worried .
`` <ARGM-TMP> A year ago </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Moody 's </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <have.04>had</have.04> <ARG1> Shearson under review for possible downgrade </ARG1> , '' he said .
`` <ARGM-TMP> After two months of talks </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> our rating </ARG1> was <maintain.01>maintained</maintain.01> . ''
<ARG0> Drexel </ARG0> , <ARGM-TMP> meanwhile </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-TMP> already </ARGM-TMP> <compete.01>competes</compete.01> <ARGM-MNR> at a disadvantage to its big Wall Street rivals </ARGM-MNR> <ARGM-CAU> because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating </ARGM-CAU> .
<ARG0> The collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> apparently </ARGM-ADV> have <take.01>taken</take.01> <ARG1> their toll </ARG1> <ARG2-on> on closely held Drexel , the leading underwriter in that market </ARG2-on> .
<ARG1> The firm </ARG1> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> has been <hit.01>hit</hit.01> <ARG2-with> with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six felonies related to a big insider-trading scandal </ARG2-with> .
<ARG0> Drexel </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> this year </ARGM-TMP> <eliminate.01>eliminated</eliminate.01> <ARG1> its retail or individual customer business </ARG1> , <ARGM-ADV> cutting the firm 's workforce almost in half to just over 5,000 </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARGM-TMP> Recently </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Drexel </ARG0> <circulate.01>circulated</circulate.01> a private financial statement <ARGM-LOC> among several securities firms </ARGM-LOC> showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years .
<ARG1> The firm 's capital </ARG1> , <ARGM-DIS> moreover </ARGM-DIS> , has <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <grow.01>grown</grow.01> <ARG2-at> at the same rate as in the past </ARG2-at> , officials at these firms say .
<ARG1> Drexel </ARG1> <remain.01>remains</remain.01> <ARG3> confident of its future creditworthiness </ARG3> .
`` <ARG1> We </ARG1> 're <ARGM-MNR> well </ARGM-MNR> <position.01>positioned</position.01> <ARG2-with> with $ 1.7 billion of capital </ARG2-with> , '' a Drexel spokesman said .
Moreover , <ARG0> we </ARG0> 've probably been the most aggressive firm on the Street in <reduce.01>reducing</reduce.01> <ARG1> costs , which are down around 40 % over the last six months </ARG1> .
Lewis C. Veraldi , the father of <ARG0> the team that </ARG0> <create.01>created</create.01> <ARG1> the highly successful Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars </ARG1> , retired early after experiencing recent heart problems .
But <ARG1> he </ARG1> is <ARGM-MNR> best </ARGM-MNR> <know.01>known</know.01> <ARGM-LOC> in the auto industry </ARGM-LOC> <ARG2-as> as the creator of a team car-development approach that produced the two midsized cars that were instrumental in helping the No. 2 auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company 's Ford division to eclipse General Motors Corp. 's Chevrolet division as the top-selling nameplate in the U.S. </ARG2-as> .
<ARGM-LOC> Under the so-called Team Taurus approach </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> Mr. Veraldi and other Ford product planners </ARG0> <seek.01>sought</seek.01> <ARG1> the involvement of parts suppliers , assembly-line workers , auto designers and financial staff members </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> from the initial stages of the development cycle </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> The concept 's goal </ARG0> was to <eliminate.01>eliminate</eliminate.01> <ARG1> bureaucracy </ARG1> and make Ford 's product development more responsive to consumer demands .
<ARG1> It </ARG1> was <ARGM-TMP> later </ARGM-TMP> <apply.02>applied</apply.02> <ARG2-to> to other new-car programs , including those that produced the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar </ARG2-to> .
<ARG0> Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersen </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARGM-TMP> yesterday </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> that Mr. Veraldi has `` helped to change the world 's perception of American-made cars </ARG1> . ''
<ARG0> Mr. Veraldi </ARG0> <work.01>worked</work.01> <ARG2-at> at Ford </ARG2-at> <ARGM-TMP> for 40 years </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-MNR> holding a variety of car and parts-engineering positions </ARGM-MNR> .
<ARG1> The limits to legal absurdity </ARG1> <stretch.01>stretched</stretch.01> <ARG2-EXT> another notch </ARG2-EXT> <ARGM-TMP> this week </ARGM-TMP> when the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from a case that says corporate defendants must pay damages even after proving that they could not possibly have caused the harm .
<ARG0> We </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <understand.01>understand</understand.01> and share <ARG1> the compassion that makes judges sometimes wish to offer a kind of Solomonic aid to those who 've been hurt </ARG1> .
But this case is a stark lesson in how <ARG0> the failures of the traditional policy-making process </ARG0> have <leave.02>left</leave.02> <ARG1> the courts </ARG1> as the only forum this country has to debate risk , technology and innovation .
<ARGM-TMP> Too often </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-TMP> now </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> a single court decision </ARG1> <become.01>becomes</become.01> <ARG2> the precedent for other , less compelling cases </ARG2> .
<ARGM-TMP> From the 1940s until 1971 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> some two million women </ARG0> <take.01>took</take.01> <ARG1> the synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol -LRB- DES -RRB- </ARG1> <ARGM-PNC> to prevent miscarriages and morning sickness </ARGM-PNC> .
<ARG1> The drug </ARG1> was <approve.01>approved</approve.01> <ARG0-by> by the Food and Drug Administration </ARG0-by> and marketed by some 300 pharmaceutical companies , often under generic labels .
<ARGM-TMP> In the 1970s </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> scientists </ARG0> <report.01>reported</report.01> <ARG1> cancer cases among the daughters of DES users </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The cases </ARG0> <ARGM-MNR> quickly </ARGM-MNR> <go.02>went</go.02> <ARG4-to> to court </ARG4-to> , but the mothers of several thousand DES plaintiffs could n't recall whose brand they used .
<begin.01><ARG1></begin.01> <ARGM-TMP> in 1980 </ARGM-TMP> , courts in several states including California and New York decided to suspend the common-law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable . </ARG1>
<ARG0> Courts </ARG0> <make.XX>made</make.XX> <ARG1> the assumption that all DES pills were essentially the same </ARG1> , and created a market-share test so that damages would be assessed against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales .
<ARG0> This </ARG0> <have.03>has</have.03> <ARG1> some logic </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Drug makers </ARG0> should n't be able to <duck.01>duck</duck.01> <ARG1> liability </ARG1> <ARGM-CAU> because people could n't identify precisely which identical drug was used </ARGM-CAU> .
But <ARG1> courts </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> quickly </ARGM-MNR> <tumble.01>tumbled</tumble.01> <ARGM-DIR> down a slippery slope </ARGM-DIR> .
<ARGM-ADV> Just as all plaintiffs are not alike </ARGM-ADV> , it <turn.11>turns</turn.11> out <ARG1> that DES defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warranties </ARG1> .
<ARG1> The ultimate result </ARG1> <come.XX>came</come.XX> in Hymowitz v. Lilly , where the highest New York court expanded the market-share approach for the first time to say that drug makers that could prove Mindy Hymowitz 's mother did n't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages .
But as <ARG0> Duke University law professor William Van Alstyne </ARG0> <note.XX>notes</note.XX> , by this reasoning a defendant could be held liable in New York for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in California .
Despite <ARG0> the Supreme Court 's </ARG0> refusal to <hear.01>hear</hear.01> <ARG1> the case </ARG1> , there are serious constitutional issues of due process and uncompensated takings from the defendants .
The big problem , however , is that there 's no guarantee that <ARG1> this reasoning </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> be <limit.01>limited</limit.01> <ARG2-to> to DES </ARG2-to> or to drugs .
<ARG1> The problem </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> here </ARGM-LOC> <go.01>goes</go.01> <ARG4-beyond> well beyond twisting legal doctrine </ARG4-beyond> .
<ARG0> The California Supreme Court </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> last year </ARGM-TMP> <reverse.01>reversed</reverse.01> <ARG1> direction </ARG1> <ARGM-PNC> to make it much harder to win DES cases </ARGM-PNC> <ARGM-CAU> because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs </ARGM-CAU> .
<ARG0> The court </ARG0> <reject.01>rejected</reject.01> <ARG1> strict liability for prescription drugs </ARG1> , <ARGM-ADV> citing the huge , hidden social costs </ARGM-ADV> .
`` <ARG0> Public policy </ARG0> <favor.01>favors</favor.01> <ARG1> the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs </ARG1> , <ARGM-ADV> even though some risks , perhaps serious ones , might accompany their introduction </ARGM-ADV> <ARGM-CAU> because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering </ARGM-CAU> , '' the unanimous court said .
<ARG0> The California justices </ARG0> <note.XX>noted</note.XX> <ARG1> that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining anti-morning-sickness drug , Bendectin , off the U.S. market </ARG1> .
<ARG0> This </ARG0> <raise.01>raises</raise.01> <ARG1> the key issue : What to do about people who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs </ARG1> ?
<ARG0> We </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> now </ARGM-TMP> <know.01>know</know.01> that holding drug makers liable where there 's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means the drugs wo n't be available to anyone .
As <ARG0> liability expert Peter Huber </ARG0> <tell.01>tells</tell.01> <ARG2> us </ARG2> , after the Hymowitz case , if any drug maker introduces an anti-miscarriage drug `` it 's time to sell that company 's stock short . ''
<ARG0> We </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <know.01>know</know.01> that the tort system is a lousy way to compensate victims anyway ; some win the legal lottery , others get much less and contingency-fee lawyers take a big cut either way .
DES daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if <ARG1> their cases </ARG1> were <take.01>taken</take.01> <ARGM-DIR> out of the courts </ARGM-DIR> .
<ARG0> Congress </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <create.01>create</create.01> a compensation program to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs .
But <ARG0> a 1986 law that </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> supposedly </ARGM-ADV> <replace.01>replaced</replace.01> <ARG1> lawsuits over children 's vaccines </ARG1> <ARG2-with> with a compensation fund </ARG2-with> has predictably led to even more litigation .
<ARG0> Everyone </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> by now </ARGM-TMP> <understand.01>understands</understand.01> that Congress is utterly incapable of writing legislation to help deserving people without its becoming some billion-dollar morass .
<ARG0> We </ARG0> <have.03>have</have.03> no doubt this is one reason judges in New York and justices on the Supreme Court are willing to trash the law in the DES cases .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> must </ARGM-MOD> <figure.01>figure</figure.01> <ARG1> that justice has to get done by somebody </ARG1> , but know it wo n't be done by Congress .

The 32 % state-owned DSM had <ARG2> eight million guilders of extraordinary charges </ARG2> in the latest quarter , <ARGM-ADV> mainly </ARGM-ADV> to <reflect.01>reflect</reflect.01> <ARG1> one-time losses in connection with the disposal of some operations </ARG1> .
<ARG1> The charges </ARG1> were <offset.01>offset</offset.01> <ARGM-MNR> in part </ARGM-MNR> <ARG2-by> by a gain from the sale of the company 's construction division </ARG2-by> .

<ARG0> Dealers </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the U.K. government 's decision Tuesday to waive its protective `` golden share '' in the auto maker raised prospects of a bidding war between the two U.S. auto giants .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> the waiver <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> was <see.01>seen</see.01> as a signal that Ford , a major U.K. auto industry employer , was able to gain government acceptance of its bid for control of Jaguar .

<ARG0> IBM , the giant computer maker , </ARG0> <offer.01>offered</offer.01> <ARG1> $ 750 million of non-callable 30-year debentures priced to yield 8.47 % , or about 1\/2 percentage point higher than the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds </ARG1> .
<ARG1> The size of IBM 's issue </ARG1> was <increase.01>increased</increase.01> <ARG3-from> from an originally planned $ 500 million </ARG3-from> <ARGM-ADV> as money managers and investors scrambled to buy the bonds </ARGM-ADV> .
In the investment-grade corporate market , `` it 's rare that <ARG0> you </ARG0> <get.01>get</get.01> <ARG1> an opportunity to buy a name that has such broad appeal and has such attractive call features </ARG1> , '' said James Ednie , a Drexel industrial bond trader .
<ARG0> Money managers </ARG0> <rank.01>ranked</rank.01> <ARG1> IBM 's offering </ARG1> <ARG2-as> as the most significant investment-grade sale of the year </ARG2-as> <ARGM-CAU> because large issues of long-term debt by companies with triple-A credit are infrequent </ARGM-CAU> .
<ARG0> Syndicate officials at lead underwriter Salomon Brothers Inc. </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the debentures were snapped by up pension funds , banks , insurance companies and other institutional investors .
<ARGM-LOC> In the Treasury market </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> investors </ARG0> <pay.01>paid</pay.01> <ARG1> scant attention </ARG1> <ARG2-to> to the day 's economic reports , which for the most part provided a mixed view of the economy </ARG2-to> .
`` Whether <ARG0> you </ARG0> <think.01>thought</think.01> the economy was growing weak or holding steady , yesterday 's economic indicators did n't change your opinion , '' said Charles Lieberman , a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp .
<ARG0> The government </ARG0> <report.01>reported</report.01> <ARG1> that orders for manufactured goods were essentially unchanged in September while construction spending was slightly lower </ARG1> .
<ARG1> Both indicators </ARG1> were <view.02>viewed</view.02> <ARG2-as> as signs that the nation 's industrial sector is growing very slowly , if at all </ARG2-as> .
<ARG0> A survey by the Federal Reserve 's 12 district banks and the latest report by the National Association of Purchasing Management </ARG0> <blur.01>blurred</blur.01> <ARG1> that picture of the economy </ARG1> .
In <ARG1> a monthly report </ARG1> <prepare.01>prepared</prepare.01> <ARG3-for> for use at the Fed 's next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Nov. 14. </ARG3-for> , the nation 's central bank found that price increases have moderated and economic activity has grown at a sluggish pace in recent weeks .
<ARGM-DIS> Among other things </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> the survey </ARG0> <find.01>found</find.01> <ARG1> that manufacturing activity varied considerably across districts and among industries </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The Philadelphia and Cleveland districts </ARG0> , <ARGM-DIS> for example </ARGM-DIS> , <report.01>reported</report.01> <ARG1> declines in manufacturing activity </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> while the Boston , Dallas and San Francisco banks noted that business expanded </ARGM-ADV> .
The <purchase.01>purchasing</purchase.01> <ARG0> managers </ARG0> index of economic activity rose in October , although it remains below 50 % .
<ARG0> A reading below 50 % </ARG0> <indicate.01>indicates</indicate.01> <ARG1> that the manufacturing sector is slowing </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> while a reading above 50 % suggests that the industry is expanding </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> Mr. Lieberman </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the diverse showing in yesterday 's reports `` only enhances the importance of the employment data . ''
The employment report , which <ARGM-TMP> at times </ARGM-TMP> has <cause.01>caused</cause.01> <ARG1> wide swings in bond prices </ARG1> , is due out tomorrow .
The average estimate of <ARG1> 22 economists </ARG1> <poll.01>polled</poll.01> <ARG0-by> by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report </ARG0-by> was that non-farm payrolls expanded by 152,000 in October .
<ARG0> The economists </ARG0> <forecast.01>forecast</forecast.01> <ARG1> a 0.1 % rise in the unemployment rate to 5.4 % </ARG1> .
<ARGM-LOC> In a surprise announcement </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> the Treasury </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it will reopen the outstanding benchmark 30-year bond rather than create a new one for next week 's quarterly refunding of the federal debt .
<ARG0> The Treasury </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <raise.01>raise</raise.01> <ARG1> $ 10 billion in fresh cash </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> by selling $ 30 billion of securities , including $ 10 billion of new three-year notes and $ 10 billion of new 10-year notes </ARGM-MNR> .
But rather than <sell.01>sell</sell.01> <ARG1> new 30-year bonds </ARG1> , <ARG0> the Treasury </ARG0> will issue $ 10 billion of 29year , nine-month bonds -- essentially increasing the size of the current benchmark 30-year bond that was sold at the previous refunding in August .
<ARG0> Credit market analysts </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the decision to reopen the current benchmark , the 8 1\/8 % bond due August 2019 , is unusual because the issue trades at a premium to its face amount .
<ARG0> Some dealers </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the Treasury 's intent is to help government bond dealers gauge investor demand for the securities , given uncertainties about when the auction will occur .
<ARG0> The Treasury </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the refunding is contingent upon congressional and presidential passage of an increase in the federal debt ceiling .
Until <ARG1> such action </ARG1> <take.14>takes</take.14> <ARG2> places </ARG2> , the Treasury has no ability to issue new debt of any kind .
<ARGM-DIS> Meanwhile </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG1> Treasury bonds </ARG1> <end.02>ended</end.02> <ARGM-EXT> modestly higher </ARGM-EXT> <ARGM-LOC> in quiet trading </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG1> The benchmark </ARG1> was <price.01>priced</price.01> <ARG2-at> at 102 22\/32 </ARG2-at> <ARGM-PNC> to yield 7.88 % </ARGM-PNC> <ARGM-ADV> compared with 102 12\/32 to yield 7.90 % Tuesday </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG1> The latest 10-year notes </ARG1> were <quote.01>quoted</quote.01> <ARG2-at> at 100 22\/32 </ARG2-at> <ARG2> to yield 7.88 % </ARG2> <ARGM-ADV> compared with 100 16\/32 to yield 7.90 % </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> IBM 's $ 750 million debenture offering </ARG0> <dominate.01>dominated</dominate.01> <ARG1> activity in the corporate debt market </ARG1> .
<ARGM-TMP> Meanwhile </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> most investment-grade bonds </ARG1> <end.02>ended</end.02> <ARGM-MNR> unchanged to as much as 1\/8 point higher </ARGM-MNR> .
<ARGM-LOC> In its latest compilation of performance statistics </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> Moody 's Investors Service </ARG0> <find.01>found</find.01> <ARG1> that investment-grade bonds posted a total return of 2.7 % in October while junk bonds showed a negative return of 1.5 % </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Moody 's </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> those returns compare with a 3.8 % total return for longer-term Treasury notes and bonds .
<ARG2> Total return </ARG2> <measure.01>measures</measure.01> <ARG1> price changes and interest income </ARG1> .
<ARG3-For> For the year to date </ARG3-For> , <ARG0> Moody 's </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> total returns were topped by the 16.5 % of longer-term Treasury issues , closely followed by 15 % for investment-grade bonds .
<ARG0> Junk bonds </ARG0> <trail.01>trailed</trail.01> <ARG1> the group </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> again </ARGM-TMP> .
`` <ARG0> Even the 7.2 % return from the risk-free three-month Treasury bill </ARG0> has <ARGM-MNR> easily </ARGM-MNR> <outdistance.01>outdistanced</outdistance.01> <ARG1> the 4.1 % return from junk bonds </ARG1> , '' wrote Moody 's economist John Lonski in yesterday 's market report .
`` Little wonder that <ARG1> buyers for junk </ARG1> have been <find.01>found</find.01> <ARG3> wanting </ARG3> , '' he said .
<ARG0> Moody 's </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the average net asset value of 24 junk-bond mutual funds fell by 4.2 % in October .
<ARG1> Mortgage securities </ARG1> <end.02>ended</end.02> <ARGM-MNR> slightly higher </ARGM-MNR> but trailed gains in the Treasury market .
<ARG1> Ginnie Mae 's 9 % issue for November delivery </ARG1> <finish.02>finished</finish.02> <ARGM-EXT> at 98 5\/8 </ARGM-EXT> , <ARGM-MNR> up 2\/32 </ARGM-MNR> , and its 9 1\/2 % issue at 100 22\/32 , also up 2\/32 .
<ARG0> The Ginnie Mae 9 % securities </ARG0> were <yield.01>yielding</yield.01> <ARG1> 9.32 % </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> to a 12-year average life </ARGM-ADV> .
Activity was light in derivative markets , with <ARG1> no new issues </ARG1> <price.01>priced</price.01> .
<ARG1> A $ 114 million issue of health facility revenue bonds from the California Health Facilities Financing Authority </ARG1> was <ARGM-TMP> temporarily </ARGM-TMP> <withdraw.01>withdrawn</withdraw.01> <ARGM-TMP> after being tentatively priced by a First Boston Corp. group </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> An official for the lead underwriter </ARG0> <decline.02>declined</decline.02> <ARG1> to comment on the reason for the delay </ARG1> , but market participants speculated that a number of factors , including a lack of investor interest , were responsible .
The issue could be relaunched , possibly in a <restructure.01>restructured</restructure.01> <ARG1> form </ARG1> , as early as next week , according to the lead underwriter .
<ARG1> A $ 107.03 million offering of Santa Ana Community Redevelopment Agency , Calif. , tax allocation bonds </ARG1> <get.11>got</get.11> off <ARG2-to> to a slow start </ARG2-to> and may be repriced at lower levels today , according to an official with lead underwriter Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp .

<ARG0> West German dealers </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> there was little interest in Treasury bonds ahead of Thursday 's new government bond issue .
So far , <ARG0> they </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> , investors appear unenthusiastic about the new issue which might force the government to raise the coupon to more than 7 % .
It is <ARGM-ADV> generally </ARGM-ADV> <expect.01>expected</expect.01> to be the usual 10-year , four billion mark issue .
Rumors to the contrary have been that it <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> be a six billion mark issue , or that <ARG1> the last Bund , a 7 % issue due October 1999 , </ARG1> would be <increase.01>increased</increase.01> <ARG2-by> by two billion marks </ARG2-by> .

<ARG0> The British Department of Trade and Industry </ARG0> <order.01>ordered</order.01> <ARG2> an investigation of the competitive impact of Michelin Tyre PLC 's planned acquisition of National Tyre Service Ltd </ARG2> .
<ARG0> The department </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it referred the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission because of the purchase 's possible effects on the U.K. market for distribution of replacement tires .
<ARG0> BTR PLC , a U.K. industrial conglomerate , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARGM-TMP> in June </ARGM-TMP> it had sold its National Tyre Service business to Michelin Investment Ltd. , a U.K. unit of the tire maker , for # 140 million -LRB- $ 221.4 million -RRB- .

<ARG0> Rep. John Dingell , an important sponsor of President Bush 's clean-air bill , </ARG0> <plan.01>plans</plan.01> <ARG1> to unveil a surprise proposal that would break with the White House on a centerpiece issue : acid rain </ARG1> .
The Michigan Democrat 's proposal , which is <expect.01>expected</expect.01> <ARGM-TMP> today </ARGM-TMP> , is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the Bush administration 's plan to cut utility emissions that lead to acid rain .
<ARG1> The administration 's plan </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <cost.01>cost</cost.01> <ARG3> utilities , mainly those that use coal , </ARG3> <ARG2> up to $ 4 billion a year </ARG2> .
<ARG1> The proposal </ARG1> <come.04>comes</come.04> <ARG2-as> as a surprise </ARG2-as> <ARGM-ADV> even to administration officials </ARGM-ADV> and temporarily throws into chaos the House 's work on clean-air legislation .
<ARGM-ADV> As chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> Mr. Dingell </ARG0> <have.03>has</have.03> <ARG1> almost single-handed control over clean-air legislation </ARG1> .
<ARG0> People close to the utility industry </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> Mr. Dingell 's proposal appears to guarantee only an estimated seven-million-ton cut in annual sulfur-dioxide emissions that lead to acid rain , though additional cuts could be ordered later .
<ARG0> Mr. Bush 's legislative package </ARG0> <promise.01>promises</promise.01> <ARG2> to cut emissions by 10 million tons -- basically in half -- by the year 2000 </ARG2> .
<ARGM-ADV> Although final details were n't available </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> sources </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the Dingell plan would abandon the president 's proposal for a cap on utilities ' sulfur-dioxide emissions .
<ARG1> That proposal </ARG1> had been <hail.02>hailed</hail.02> <ARG0-by> by environmentalists </ARG0-by> but despised by utilities because they feared it would limit their growth .
<ARG0> It </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <junk.01>junk</junk.01> <ARG1> an innovative market-based system for trading emissions credits among polluters </ARG1> .
<ARGM-DIS> In addition </ARGM-DIS> , it is <believe.01>believed</believe.01> to offer a cost-sharing mechanism that would help subsidize the clean-up costs for the dirtiest coal-fired utilities in the country , sparing their customers from exorbitant jumps in their electric bills .
<ARG1> The administration </ARG1> , <stick.01>sticking</stick.01> <ARG2-to> to its vow of avoiding tax increases </ARG2-to> , has staunchly opposed cost-sharing .
Mr. Dingell 's staff was <expect.01>expected</expect.01> to present its acid-rain alternative to other committee members , apparently in an attempt to appease Midwestern lawmakers from high-polluting states who insist on cost-sharing .
It is n't clear , however , whether <ARG0> support for the proposal </ARG0> will be broad enough to <pose.02>pose</pose.02> <ARG1> a serious challenge </ARG1> <ARG2-to> to the White House 's acid-rain plan </ARG2-to> .
While <ARG0> the new proposal </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> might </ARGM-MOD> <appeal.03>appeal</appeal.03> <ARG1-to> to the dirtiest utilities </ARG1-to> , it might not win the support of utilities , many in the West , that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner-burning fuels .
<ARG0> Lawmakers </ARG0> <represent.01>representing</represent.01> <ARG1> some of the cleaner utilities </ARG1> have been quietly working with the White House to devise ways to tinker with the administration bill to address their acid-rain concerns .
<ARG0> American City Business Journals Inc. </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> its president , Michael K. Russell , will resign rather than relocate to new headquarters in Charlotte , N.C .

<ARG0> New York financier Saul Steinberg </ARG0> <seek.01>sought</seek.01> <ARG1> federal permission to buy more than 15 % of United Airlines ' parent , UAL Corp. </ARG1> , saying he might seek control of the nation 's second-largest airline .
Although <ARG0> takeover experts </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> they doubted Mr. Steinberg will make a bid by himself , the application by his Reliance Group Holdings Inc. could signal his interest in helping revive a failed labor-management bid .
Such an application for federal antitrust clearance is necessary for <ARG0> any investor that </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> might </ARGM-MOD> <seek.01>seek</seek.01> <ARG1> control </ARG1> .
But <ARG0> some investors </ARG0> have <use.01>used</use.01> <ARG1> such filings </ARG1> <ARG2-PNC> to boost the value of their stock holdings , which -- without buying more stock -- they then sold </ARG2-PNC> .
<ARG1> Takeover stock traders </ARG1> were <puzzle.01>puzzled</puzzle.01> <ARG0-by> by the Reliance filing </ARG0-by> and cautioned that it does n't mean Mr. Steinberg will definitely seek control .
`` <ARGM-DIS> Maybe </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> he </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> just </ARGM-ADV> <want.01>wants</want.01> <ARG1> to make something happen </ARG1> , '' said one takeover expert .
<ARG0> One investment banker </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> Mr. Steinberg may be trying to position himself as a friendly investor who could help UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf revive a failed labor-management bid .
Mr. Steinberg , <ARG0> he </ARG0> <suggest.01>suggested</suggest.01> , could replace British Airways PLC , which has withdrawn from the buy-out group .
<ARG0> Reliance </ARG0> had <ARGM-TMP> already </ARGM-TMP> <buy.01>bought</buy.01> and sold <ARG1> UAL stock </ARG1> <ARG3-at> at a big profit </ARG3-at> <ARGM-ADV> without making an antitrust filing before the collapse Oct. 13 of the $ 6.79 billion , $ 300-a-share labor-management buy-out </ARGM-ADV> .

<ARG0> Market sources </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> Reliance has already sold its entire UAL stake , and thus would n't have any reason to file the application simply to boost the value of its stock .
But <ARG1> the exact amount of Reliance 's current holding </ARG1> has <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> been <ARGM-MNR> formally </ARGM-MNR> <disclose.01>disclosed</disclose.01> .

<ARG0> Reliance </ARG0> <confirm.01>confirmed</confirm.01> <ARG1> the filing </ARG1> but would n't elaborate .
<ARG0> Some takeover experts </ARG0> were skeptical , <say.01>saying</say.01> it was possible that Mr. Steinberg made the filing only to help boost the value of any remaining Reliance stake in UAL .
Mr. Steinberg is <think.01>thought</think.01> to be on friendly terms with UAL 's Mr. Wolf .
<ARG0> The investor </ARG0> was instrumental in <tap.02>tapping</tap.02> <ARG1> Mr. Wolf </ARG1> <ARG3> to run the air cargo unit of Tiger International Inc </ARG3> .

<ARGM-LOC> In an interview </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG0> Donald Beall , chairman , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> first-half profit certainly would trail the past year 's , primarily because of weakness in the heavy-truck and passenger-car markets .
Still , <ARG0> he </ARG0> <add.01>added</add.01> , if the industrial sector remains relatively stable , Rockwell should be able to recover in the second half and about equal fiscal 1989 's operating profit of $ 630.9 million .

<ARG1> That </ARG1> <compare.01>compares</compare.01> <ARG2-with> with operating earnings of $ 132.9 million , or 49 cents a share , the year earlier </ARG2-with> .
<ARG2> The prior-year period </ARG2> <include.01>includes</include.01> <ARG1> a one-time favorable tax adjustment on the B-1B bomber program and another gain from sale of the industrial sewing-machine business , which made net $ 185.9 million , or 70 cents a share </ARG1> .

For the year , <bolster.01>bolstered</bolster.01> <ARG0-by> by the introduction of the Colorliner newspaper-printing press </ARG0-by> , <ARG1> graphics earnings </ARG1> almost doubled .
<ARG1> Aerospace earnings </ARG1> <sag.01>sagged</sag.01> <ARG2-EXT> 37 % for the quarter and 15 % for the year </ARG2-EXT> , <ARGM-CAU> largely due to lower B-1B program profit </ARGM-CAU> ; the last of the bombers rolled out in April 1988 .
<ARG1> That </ARG1> was <ARGM-MNR> partially </ARGM-MNR> <offset.01>offset</offset.01> <ARG2-by> by the resumption of space shuttle flights and increased demand for expendable launch-vehicle engines </ARG2-by> .

<ARG1> World sugar futures prices </ARG1> <soar.01>soared</soar.01> <ARGM-CAU> on rumors that Brazil , a major grower and exporter , might not ship sugar this crop year and next </ARGM-CAU> .
<ARG1> Prices </ARG1> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> were <boost.01>boosted</boost.01> <ARG0-by> by another rumor that Mexico , usually a large producer and exporter , might have to buy a large quantity of sugar </ARG0-by> .
<ARGM-DIS> Although </ARGM-DIS> <ARG1> traders </ARG1> <rush.01>rushed</rush.01> <ARG2> to buy futures contracts </ARG2> , many remained skeptical about the Brazilian development , which could n't be confirmed , analysts said .
<ARG1> The March and May contracts </ARG1> <rise.01>rose</rise.01> <ARG4-to> to fresh life-of-contract highs of 14.54 cents and 14.28 cents </ARG4-to> <ARGM-TMP> at their best levels of the day </ARGM-TMP> .
The March delivery , which <have.03>has</have.03> <ARG1> no limits </ARG1> , settled at 14.53 cents , up 0.56 cent a pound .
<ARG1> The May contract , which also is without restraints , </ARG1> <end.01>ended</end.01> <ARG2-with> with a gain of 0.54 cent to 14.26 cents </ARG2-with> .
<ARG1> The July delivery </ARG1> <rise.01>rose</rise.01> <ARG2-EXT> its daily permissible limit of 0.50 cent a pound </ARG2-EXT> <ARG4-to> to 14.00 cents </ARG4-to> , <ARGM-ADV> while other contract months showed near-limit advances </ARGM-ADV> .
According to <ARG1> reports </ARG1> <carry.01>carried</carry.01> <ARG0-by> by various news services </ARG0-by> , the Brazilian government told its sugar producers that they wo n't be allowed to export sugar during the current 1989-90 season , which began May 1 , and the 1990-91 season so that it can be used to produce alcohol for automobile fuel .
<ARG0> One analyst , Arthur Stevenson , of Prudential-Bache Securities , New York , </ARG0> <estimate.01>estimated</estimate.01> <ARG1> that 65 % or more of Brazil 's newly made automobiles run on alcohol and ca n't use gasoline </ARG1> .
`` This is <ARG1> a demand that </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> must </ARGM-MOD> be <meet.01>met</meet.01> , <ARGM-ADV> regardless of the price of oil </ARGM-ADV> , '' said Mr. Stevenson .
<ARG0> A shift to <produce.01>producing</produce.01> <ARG1> more alcohol and less sugar </ARG1> had been expected , but the latest news , if true , indicates a more drastic shift than had been anticipated . </ARG0>
<ARGM-TMP> During the current crop year </ARGM-TMP> , Brazil was <expect.01>expected</expect.01> to produce 6.9 million tons of sugar , a drop from 8.1 million tons in 1988-89 .
Its 1989-90 exports were <expect.01>expected</expect.01> to total 645,000 tons in contrast to shipments of 1.5 million tons in
`` <ARG1> It is these 645,000 tons that are in question for this crop year </ARG1> , '' <explain.01>explained</explain.01> <ARG0> Judith Ganes , analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton , New York </ARG0> .
`` <ARG2> Producers </ARG2> were <grant.01>granted</grant.01> the right <ARGM-TMP> earlier this year </ARGM-TMP> to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected to have begun to be issued '' yesterday .
As a result , <ARG0> Ms. Ganes </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> , it is believed that little or no sugar from the 1989-90 crop has been shipped yet , even though the crop year is six months old .
More than a half of <ARG1> all sugar </ARG1> <produce.01>produced</produce.01> <ARGM-LOC> in Brazil </ARGM-LOC> goes for alcohol production , according to Ms. Ganes .
Also , there has been a switch in the past decade to planting of orange trees in <ARG1> areas that </ARG1> were <ARGM-TMP> previously </ARGM-TMP> <use.01>used</use.01> <ARG2-for> for cane </ARG2-for> , and this change is being felt now , she said .
Most important , <ARG0> Ms. Ganes </ARG0> <note.XX>noted</note.XX> , `` Brazilian officials said that no decision has as yet been made on the suspension of exports . ''
<ARG0> Thomas Oxnard , sugar analyst for PaineWebber in Hackensack , N.J. , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> : `` <ARG1> I am highly skeptical that Brazil will curtail sugar exports , particularly with the price of sugar at over 14 cents a pound </ARG1> . ''
Above all , <ARG0> Mr. Oxnard </ARG0> <note.XX>noted</note.XX> , the situation is extremely confused .
`` <ARG0> Professional sugar people here who </ARG0> <have.03>have</have.03> <ARG1> strong contacts with the Brazilian sugar industry </ARG1> have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation , '' he said .
`` It 's the type of <ARGM-LOC> nervous atmosphere in which </ARGM-LOC> a report <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> be <put.10>put</put.10> out , such as the one saying exports will be suspended , and no one can confirm it . ''
<ARG0> Mr. Oxnard </ARG0> <observe.02>observed</observe.02> <ARG1> that the situation in Brazil is also very complicated </ARG1> .
<ARGM-DIS> On the one hand </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> Brazil </ARG0> <start.01>started</start.01> <ARG1> an ethanol program </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> about 15 years ago </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-PNC> to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars </ARGM-PNC> and is now committed to this program .
`` It <have.02>has</have.02> to weigh , on the other hand , the relatively high price of sugar it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol , '' Mr. Oxnard said .
<ARG0> Mexico , which is normally a sugar exporter , </ARG0> has <have.03>had</have.03> <ARG1> production problems </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> in the past two years </ARGM-TMP> , analysts said .
<ARGM-TMP> Last year </ARGM-TMP> , it <have.02>had</have.02> to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments , they noted .
<ARGM-TMP> This year </ARGM-TMP> it is <expect.01>expected</expect.01> to be a net importer and is said to be seeking to buy about 200,000 tons of sugar to meet internal needs , analysts said .
Petroleum futures were generally higher with <ARG0> heating oil </ARG0> <lead.01>leading</lead.01> <ARG1> the way </ARG1> .
<ARGM-LOC> On the New York Mercantile Exchange </ARGM-LOC> , <ARG1> heating oil for December delivery </ARG1> <increase.01>increased</increase.01> <ARG2-EXT> 1.25 cents </ARG2-EXT> <ARGM-PNC> to settle at 60.36 cents a gallon </ARGM-PNC> .
<ARG1> Gasoline futures </ARG1> were <mix.01>mixed</mix.01> to unchanged .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> the strength in heating oil </ARG0> <help.01>helped</help.01> <ARG1> push up crude oil </ARG1> .

<ARG1> The firmness in heating oil </ARG1> was <attribute.01>attributed</attribute.01> to colder weather in parts of the U.S. and <ARG2-to> to the latest weekly report by the American Petroleum Institute , which showed a decline in inventories of the fuel </ARG2-to> .
<ARG1> Prices </ARG1> <close.02>closed</close.02> <ARGM-MNR> mostly higher </ARGM-MNR> <ARGM-LOC> in relatively light trading </ARGM-LOC> as farmers continued to withhold their crops from the marketplace in the hope of higher prices to come .

<ARGM-ADV> As an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the U.S. </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> market analysts </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that late Tuesday the Chinese government , which often buys U.S. grains in quantity , turned instead to Britain to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Traders </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> prices also were supported by widespread rumors that the Soviet Union is on the verge of receiving most favored nation status from the U.S. .
<ARG0> That designation </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> , <ARGM-ADV> among other things </ARGM-ADV> , <provide.01>provide</provide.01> <ARG1> more generous credit terms under which the Soviets could purchase grain </ARG1> .

<ARGM-ADV> Separately </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> Reuter </ARG0> <report.01>reported</report.01> <ARG1> that the Papua-New Guinea government urged its Parliament to extend a state of emergency in copper-rich Bougainville Island for two months </ARG1> .

<ARG1> The parent of Younkers </ARG1> , after <fail.01>failing</fail.01> <ARG2> to find a buyer for the chain of Midwestern department stores </ARG2> , said it will sell a stake in the chain to management and take other steps to reduce its investment in retailing .
<ARG0> Equitable of Iowa Cos. , Des Moines , </ARG0> had been <seek.01>seeking</seek.01> <ARG1> a buyer for the 36-store Younkers chain </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> since June , when it announced its intention to free up capital to expand its insurance business </ARGM-TMP> .
But <ARG0> Equitable </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it was unable to find a buyer willing to pay what it considers `` fair value '' for Younkers because of recent turmoil in the bond and stock markets and in retailing .
<ARG0> Younkers </ARG0> <ring.03>rang</ring.03> up sales <ARGM-TMP> in 1988 </ARGM-TMP> of $ 313 million .

<ARGM-TMP> Previously </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> it </ARG0> <offer.01>offered</offer.01> <ARG2> $ 13.65 a share in cash , or $ 29 million </ARG2> .
<ARG0> The El Paso , Texas , maker of Western boots and leather accessories </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the preferred stock would accrue dividends at a 12 % rate , but would n't be paid for the first two years .
<ARG1> The stock </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> be <redeem.01>redeemed</redeem.01> <ARGM-TMP> in five years </ARGM-TMP> , <ARGM-ADV> subject to terms of the surviving company 's debt </ARGM-ADV> .

The October survey of corporate <purchase.01>purchasing</purchase.01> <ARG0> managers </ARG0> , as expected , provided evidence that economic growth remains subdued .
<ARG1> An index of economic activity </ARG1> <draw.XX>drawn</draw.XX> <ARG2-from> from the survey </ARG2-from> stood last month at 47.6 % ; a reading above 50 % would have indicated that the manufacturing sector was improving .

<ARG0> Uncertainty about the prospects for further action to <curtail.01>curtail</curtail.01> <ARG1> stock-index arbitrage , a form of program trading blamed for recent volatility in the market , </ARG1> also contributed to its lack of direction , Mr. Puccio said . </ARG0>

<ARG0> All this </ARG0> has <cast.01>cast</cast.01> <ARG1> a pall </ARG1> <ARG2-over> over Columbia Savings & Loan Association and its high-rolling 43-year-old chairman , Thomas Spiegel , who built the $ 12.7 billion Beverly Hills , Calif. , thrift with high-yield junk bonds </ARG2-over> .
<ARG0> Bears </ARG0> have <target.01>targeted</target.01> <ARG1> Columbia 's stock </ARG1> <ARGM-CAU> because of the thrift 's exposure to the shaky junk market </ARGM-CAU> .
<ARGM-DIS> And </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> some investors </ARG0> <fault.01>fault</fault.01> <ARG1> Mr. Spiegel 's life style </ARG1> ; he earns millions of dollars a year and flies around in Columbia 's jet planes .
<ARG0> Columbia stock </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> recently </ARGM-TMP> <hit.02>hit</hit.02> <ARG1> 4 1\/8 </ARG1> , <ARGM-TMP> after reaching 11 3\/4 earlier this year on rumors that Mr. Spiegel would take the thrift private </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARGM-DIS> Moreover </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> junk professionals </ARG0> <think.01>think</think.01> <ARG1> Columbia 's huge third-quarter markdown of its junk portfolio to $ 4.4 billion was n't enough </ARG1> , meaning another markdown could be coming .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARGM-TMP> in recent days </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> Columbia </ARG1> has <edge.01>edged</edge.01> <ARG5> up </ARG5> , <ARGM-ADV> closing at 5 1\/4 , up 3\/8 , yesterday on revived speculation that the thrift might restructure </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> Mr. Spiegel 's fans </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> Columbia 's Southern California branches are highly salable , and the thrift has $ 458 million of shareholders equity underlying its assets .
That 's almost $ 10 of equity for <ARG2> each Columbia share </ARG2> , <include.01>including</include.01> <ARG1> convertible preferred shares </ARG1> , though more junk markdowns would reduce the cushion .
<ARG0> Columbia </ARG0> <have.03>has</have.03> <ARG1> only about 10 million common shares in public hands </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The Spiegel family </ARG0> <have.03>has</have.03> <ARG1> 25 % of the common and 75 % of the votes </ARG1> .
Other big common holders are Carl Lindner 's American Financial , investor Irwin Jacobs and Pacific Financial Research , though <ARG0> the latter </ARG0> <cut.02>cut</cut.02> <ARG1> its stake </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> this summer </ARGM-TMP> .
While <ARG0> many problems </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <attend.01>attend</attend.01> <ARG1> a restructuring of Columbia </ARG1> , investors say Mr. Spiegel is mulling such a plan to mitigate Columbia 's junk problems .
<ARGM-DIS> Indeed </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> Columbia executives </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> recently </ARGM-TMP> <tell.01>told</tell.01> <ARG2> reporters </ARG2> they were interested in creating a separate unit to hold Columbia 's junk bonds and perhaps do merchant banking .
<ARG0> Columbia </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> wo </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <comment.01>comment</comment.01> <ARG1-on> on all the speculation </ARG1-on> .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARGM-MNR> like other thrifts </ARGM-MNR> , it 's <expect.01>expected</expect.01> to seek regulators ' consent to create a distinct junk-bond entity .
<ARG0> Plans to <do.02>do</do.02> <ARG1> this </ARG1> are due to be filed in a week or so . </ARG0>
<ARG0> New rules </ARG0> <force.01>force</force.01> <ARG1> thrifts </ARG1> <ARG2> to write down their junk to market value , then sell the bonds over five years </ARG2> .
That 's why <ARG0> Columbia </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> just </ARGM-TMP> <write.02>wrote</write.02> off <ARG1> $ 130 million of its junk </ARG1> and reserved $ 227 million for future junk losses .
But if <ARG0> Columbia </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <keep.02>keep</keep.02> <ARG1> its junk bonds separate from the thrift </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> till they mature -- at full value , unless the issuer goes bust or restructures -- </ARGM-TMP> the junk portfolio might do all right .
<ARG0> Columbia , a longtime Drexel client , </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> wo </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <provide.01>provide</provide.01> <ARG1> current data on its junk </ARG1> .
But <ARG0> its 17 big junk holdings </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> at year end </ARGM-TMP> <show.01>showed</show.01> <ARG1> only a few bonds that have been really battered </ARG1> .
These were Allied Stores , Western Union Telegraph , Gillett Holdings , SCI Television and Texas Air , though <ARG0> many other bonds in Columbia 's portfolio </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> have <lose.02>lost</lose.02> <ARG1> value </ARG1> .
<ARGM-ADV> Possibly </ARGM-ADV> <offset.01>offsetting</offset.01> <ARG1> that </ARG1> , <ARG0> Columbia </ARG0> recently estimated it has unrealized gains on publicly traded equity investments of more than $ 70 million .
<ARG0> It </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <hope.01>hopes</hope.01> <ARG1-for> for ultimate gains of as much as $ 300 million on equity investments in buy-outs and restructurings </ARG1-for> .
One trial balloon Mr. Spiegel is <say.01>said</say.01> to have floated to investors : Columbia might be broken up , as Mellon Bank was split into a good bank and a bad bank .
But Columbia 's good bank would be a <regulate.01>regulated</regulate.01> <ARG1> thrift </ARG1> , while the bad bank would be a private investment company , holding some of Columbia 's junk bonds , real estate and equity investments .
<ARG0> Some </ARG0> <think.01>think</think.01> Columbia 's thrift , which now is seeking a new chief operating officer , might be capitalized at , say $ 300 million , and shopped to a commercial bank that wants a California presence .
<ARG1> The thrift </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> surely </ARGM-MNR> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> be <sell.01>sold</sell.01> <ARG3-for> for more than the value of its equity </ARG3-for> , financial industry executives say .
<ARGM-DIS> Meanwhile </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG1> the bad bank with the junk bonds -- and some capital -- </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> might </ARGM-MOD> be <spin.02>spun</spin.02> off <ARG3-to> to Columbia shareholders , including Mr. Spiegel , who might then have a new career </ARG3-to> , investors say .
It is n't clear how much <ARG0> a restructuring </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <help.01>help</help.01> <ARG2> Columbia stockholders </ARG2> .
<ARG0> You </ARG0> <sell.01>sell</sell.01> <ARG1> the good bank </ARG1> <ARGM-MNR> as an ongoing operation </ARGM-MNR> and use some of the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank , '' says thrift specialist Lewis Ranieri of Ranieri Associates in New York .
<ARG0> Few people </ARG0> <think.01>think</think.01> Mr. Spiegel wants to run a bread-and-butter thrift , which current rules would force Columbia to become .
`` <ARG1> They are n't really a thrift </ARG1> , '' <say.01>says</say.01> <ARG0> Jonathan Gray , a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst </ARG0> .
<ARGM-DIS> Of course </ARGM-DIS> , regulators <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <have.02>have</have.02> to approve Columbia 's reorganization .
And <ARG0> some investment bankers </ARG0> <say.01>say</say.01> a restructuring is n't feasible while the SEC still is scrutinizing Mr. Spiegel 's past junk-bond trades .

''
People familiar with the Senate Judiciary Committee , which <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <vote.01>vote</vote.01> <ARG1-on> on the nomination </ARG1-on> , said some liberal members of the panel are likely to question the ABA rating in hearings on the matter .
<ARG0> Mr. Thomas , currently chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <add.02>add</add.02> <ARG1> another conservative voice </ARG1> <ARG2-to> to the closely divided court </ARG2-to> .
<ARG0> Groups </ARG0> have <accuse.01>accused</accuse.01> <ARG1> him </ARG1> of advocating policies that narrowed rights of older workers and <ARG2-of> of ignoring discrimination by large companies </ARG2-of> .
<ARG0> Fourteen members of the House with jurisdiction over the EEOC </ARG0> have <say.01>said</say.01> they oppose Mr. Thomas 's nomination because of `` serious questions about his judgment -LCB- and -RCB- respect for the law . ''
<ARG0> A senior Justice Department official </ARG0> , <ARGM-DIS> however </ARGM-DIS> , <say.01>said</say.01> the administration is n't worried about the ABA rating .
`` <ARG1> We </ARG1> 're <please.01>pleased</please.01> the ABA rated him qualified , '' David Runkel , the department 's chief spokesman , said in an interview .
<ARG0> The ABA </ARG0> <give.01>gives</give.01> <ARG1> a `` qualified '' rating </ARG1> to nominees it believes would perform `` satisfactorily '' on the bench .

Lentjes ' product mix of <specialize.01>specialized</specialize.01> <ARG0> boilers and pipes </ARG0> provides a good fit with its own Lurgi G.m.b . H. plant engineering unit , the company said .

<ARG1> The sale </ARG1> <come.04>comes</come.04> <ARGM-MNR> in place of a planned initial public offering of Lentjes stock </ARGM-MNR> .
<ARG0> A plan to <bring.01>bring</bring.01> <ARG1> the stock </ARG1> <ARG2-to> to market </ARG2-to> <ARGM-TMP> before year end </ARGM-TMP> apparently was upset by the recent weakness of Frankfurt share prices . </ARG0>
<ARG0> The U.S. International Trade Commission </ARG0> <issue.01>issued</issue.01> <ARG1> preliminary rulings under the U.S. anti-dumping act that imports of sweaters from Hong Kong , Taiwan and South Korea may be injuring a domestic industry </ARG1> .
<ARGM-CAU> Because of the rulings </ARGM-CAU> , <ARG0> the Commerce Department </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <continue.01>continue</continue.01> <ARG1> to investigate complaints by U.S. sweater makers that the imports are reaching the U.S. at unfairly low prices in violation of the U.S. anti-dumping act </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The law </ARG0> <define.01>defines</define.01> <ARG1> unfairly low prices </ARG1> <ARG2-as> as ones below the cost of production or below prices in an exporter 's home market </ARG2-as> .
<ARG0> ITC officials </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> final Commerce Department and ITC rulings wo n't come until next March or later .
If <ARG0> both agencies </ARG0> <find.01>find</find.01> <ARG1> violations of the U.S. trade law </ARG1> , the U.S. would assess penalty duties on the imports , which already are subject to import quotas under bilateral textile and apparel trade agreements .

<ARG0> Upjohn Co. </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it will offer an early retirement package to as many as 1,100 employees in a cost-cutting move expected to result in a fourth-quarter charge .
<ARG0> Upjohn officials </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> they could n't estimate the size of the charge until they determine which employees , and how many , will participate in the retirement plan .
But <ARG0> the pharmaceutical company </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it `` anticipates the long-term savings resulting from the plan 's implementation will more than offset short-term costs . ''
<ARG0> The program , available to Upjohn employees 55 years old or older , </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <increase.01>increase</increase.01> <ARG1> an individual 's retirement benefits </ARG1> <ARG2-EXT> 10 % to 20 % </ARG2-EXT> .

<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> some analysts </ARG0> <question.01>questioned</question.01> <ARG1> how much of an impact the retirement package will have </ARG1> , <ARGM-PNC> because few jobs will end up being eliminated </ARGM-PNC> .
`` <ARG1> It 's a cosmetic move </ARG1> , '' <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG0> Jonathan S. Gelles of Wertheim Schroder & Co </ARG0> .

Any question as to <ARGM-CAU> why </ARGM-CAU> <ARG0> an author </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <believe.01>believe</believe.01> this plaintive , high-minded note of assurance is necessary is answered by reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers .
Bribe by bribe , <ARG0> Mr. Sternberg and his co-author , Matthew C.

<ARG1> The book </ARG1> <revolve.01>revolves</revolve.01> <ARG2-around> around John Mariotta , the founder of the company , and Fred Neuberger , who became his partner soon after Wedtech 's creation </ARG2-around> .
Although <start.01>started</start.01> <ARGM-TMP> in 1965 </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> Wedtech </ARG1> did n't really get rolling until 1975 , when Mr. Neuberger discovered the federal government 's Section 8 -LRB- A -RRB- minority business program .
This is <ARG0> a Johnson-era , Great Society creation that </ARG0> <mandate.01>mandates</mandate.01> certain government contracts be awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses .
<ARG0> Mr. Neuberger </ARG0> <realize.01>realized</realize.01> <ARG1> that , although of Italian ancestry , Mr. Mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in Puerto Rico </ARG1> .

<ARG0> Wedtech </ARG0> did <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <ARGM-ADV> just </ARGM-ADV> <use.01>use</use.01> <ARG1> old fashioned bribery </ARG1> .
<ARG0> It </ARG0> <make.XX>made</make.XX> <ARG1> ample use </ARG1> <ARG2-of> of the modern techniques of influence peddling </ARG2-of> , <ARGM-ADV> retaining politically connected `` respectable '' law firms , investment bankers and political consultants , including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARGM-TMP> When necessary </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> it </ARG0> <seek.01>sought</seek.01> and received <ARG1> assistance </ARG1> <ARG2-from> from organized crime </ARG2-from> .
<ARGM-TMP> Sometimes </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> the bribed </ARG1> <become.01>became</become.01> <ARG2> partners in the company </ARG2> .
<ARG0> Wedtech management </ARG0> <use.01>used</use.01> <ARG1> the merit system </ARG1> .
<ARGM-ADV> If <ARG0> you </ARG0> were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme </ARGM-ADV> you <receive.01>received</receive.01> <ARG1> not just cash in a bag , but equity </ARG1> .
<ARGM-ADV> If <ARG0> you </ARG0> were not an effective crook </ARGM-ADV> , you <find.01>found</find.01> <ARG1-REC> yourself </ARG1-REC> <ARGM-LOC> out in the cold </ARGM-LOC> , a fate that eventually befell Mr. Mariotta , the firm 's semiliterate `` minority '' person .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARGM-ADV> despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy , easy-to-read tabloid writing style </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG1> `` Feeding Frenzy '' </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> often </ARGM-TMP> <fall.01>falls</fall.01> <ARG4> short of gripping reading </ARG4> .
<ARG0> None of the scams </ARG0> <show.01>show</show.01> <ARG1> much ingenuity </ARG1> : Auditors found crookery the first day on the job .
<ARG0> Wedtech 's scammers </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> simply </ARGM-ADV> <bribe.01>bribed</bribe.01> <ARG1> them </ARG1> <ARG2> to shut up </ARG2> .
The scammers themselves were garden-variety low lifes , <ARG0> conspicuous consumers who </ARG0> <want.01>wanted</want.01> <ARG1> big houses , Mercedes cars , beautiful women , expensive clothes </ARG1> .
<ARGM-ADV> Among the lot of them </ARGM-ADV> , <ARG0> not one </ARG0> is <wrestle.01>wrestling</wrestle.01> <ARG1-with> with good and evil </ARG1-with> , or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane .
The one character at least somewhat interesting was Irving Louis Lobsenz , <ARG0> a pediatrician who </ARG0> <change.01>changed</change.01> <ARG1> his name </ARG1> <ARG2-to> to Rusty Kent London </ARG2-to> and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack .
<ARG0> He </ARG0> <enter.01>enters</enter.01> <ARG1> the story </ARG1> toward the end , just in time to get arrested .
<absorb.01>Absorbed</absorb.01> <ARG0-in> in doling out `` Feeding Frenzy 's '' tidbits </ARG0-in> , <ARG1> the authors </ARG1> gloss over the root causes of Wedtech , namely the Section 8 -LRB- A -RRB- federal program under whose auspices the scandal took place .
<ARG1> They </ARG1> do <ARGM-DIS> at least </ARGM-DIS> <come.XX>come</come.XX> <ARGM-DIR> around </ARGM-DIR> <ARG2-to> to saying that the courts might want to end `` rigid affirmative action programs </ARG2-to> . ''
<ARG0> Programs like Section 8 -LRB- A -RRB- are a little like <leave.02>leaving</leave.02> <ARG1> gold </ARG1> <ARGM-LOC> in the street </ARGM-LOC> and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up . </ARG0>
<ARG0> Numerous other scandals , among them the ones at HUD , </ARG0> <have.03>have</have.03> <ARG1> the same characteristics as Wedtech </ARG1> .
<ARG1> They </ARG1> <take.14>take</take.14> <ARG2> place </ARG2> <ARGM-LOC> in government programs that seem tailor-made for corruption </ARGM-LOC> .
Why are <ARG1> programs like this </ARG1> <ARGM-NEG> not </ARGM-NEG> <eliminate.01>eliminated</eliminate.01> ?
`` <ARG0> Feeding Frenzy </ARG0> '' does <provide.01>provide</provide.01> <ARG1> a few clues </ARG1> .
In and around all levels of government in the U.S. are <ARG1> groups of people who </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-ADV> best </ARGM-ADV> be <describe.01>described</describe.01> <ARG2-as> as belonging to a political insider commercial party </ARG2-as> .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <know.01>know</know.01> that whenever government is redistributing wealth , regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment , there is big money to be made in influencing , brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government .
They are our version of the East bloc 's Nomenklatura and <ARG0> they </ARG0> <have.03>have</have.03> <ARG1> absolutely no wish to see anything change </ARG1> .
<ARG1> How many government programs and policies </ARG1> <exist.01>exist</exist.01> <ARGM-CAU> because they line the pockets of political insiders </ARGM-CAU> ?
This is <ARG1> the real issue </ARG1> <raise.01>raised</raise.01> <ARG0-by> by the Wedtech scandal </ARG0-by> .
<ARG0> The Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy </ARG0> <agree.01>agreed</agree.01> <ARGM-MNR> in principle </ARGM-MNR> <ARG1> to form a new company to complete most of the troubled shipyard 's backlog of 15 ships </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The new company </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <attempt.01>attempt</attempt.01> <ARG1> to limit the shipyard 's losses </ARG1> , participants said .
`` The situation is that <ARG1> the bankruptcy court </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <get.05>get</get.05> <ARG2-out> out of the shipbuilding business </ARG2-out> .
<ARG1> Everything </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> be <take.12>taken</take.12> over <ARG0-by> by the new company </ARG0-by> , '' said Christian Andersson , executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae , former parent of Waertsilae Marine .
Once <ARG1> its ownership </ARG1> is <finalize.01>finalized</finalize.01> , the new company will open talks with state-appointed receivers to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine 's shipyard facilities .
<ARG3> Subcontractors </ARG3> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> be <offer.01>offered</offer.01> <ARG1> a settlement </ARG1> and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine 's two big shipyards , government officials said .
Under <ARG1> an accord </ARG1> <sign.02>signed</sign.02> <ARGM-TMP> yesterday </ARGM-TMP> , the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company , each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa -LRB- $ 23.5 million -RRB- .
<ARG0> Oy Waertsilae </ARG0> is to <contribute.01>contribute</contribute.01> <ARG1> 200 million markkaa , most of it as subordinated debt , </ARG1> and take a minority stake in the new company .
<ARG0> Customers </ARG0> <hold.01>holding</hold.01> <ARG1> contracts for Waertsilae Marine 's undelivered ships </ARG1> are expected to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital , government officials said .
Carnival , which <have.03>has</have.03> <ARG1> three ships on order from Waertsilae Marine </ARG1> , presented claims for $ 1.5 billion damages in the bankruptcy court this week .
<ARG1> Waertsilae Marine 's bankruptcy proceedings </ARG1> <begin.01>began</begin.01> <ARGM-TMP> Tuesday </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-LOC> in a Helsinki court </ARGM-LOC> .
Its plans to be <acquire.01>acquired</acquire.01> dashed , <ARG1> Comprehensive </ARG1> Care Corp. said it plans to sell most of its psychiatric and drug abuse facilities in California and some other assets to pay its debt and provide working capital .
<ARGM-DIS> In all </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> the company </ARG0> <hope.01>hopes</hope.01> <ARG1> to repay $ 45 million in debt through the sales , which will completely discharge its secured debt </ARG1> , the company said .
<ARGM-DIS> In addition </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> the company </ARG0> has <replace.01>replaced</replace.01> <ARG1> its president and chief executive </ARG1> , <ARGM-ADV> naming W. James Nichol , head of the company 's contract health services , to succeed B. Lee Karns </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> Mr. Nichol </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> he was `` extremely disappointed in the continuing deterioration of the company 's operations while it attempted to conclude the reorganization during the past four months . ''
<ARGM-TMP> Concurrent with Mr. Nichol 's appointment </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG0> Comprehensive Care </ARG0> <move.01>moved</move.01> <ARG1> its corporate headquarters </ARG1> <ARGM-DIR> from Irvine , Calif. , </ARGM-DIR> <ARG2-to> to St. Louis , where the company maintained its contract services offices </ARG2-to> .
<ARG1> Mr. Karns </ARG1> <continue.01>continues</continue.01> <ARGM-MNR> as chairman </ARGM-MNR> .
<ARG0> Comprehensive Care </ARG0> had <agree.01>agreed</agree.01> <ARG1> to be acquired by closely held First Hospital Corp. of Norfolk , Va. , </ARG1> but the sale sputtered almost from the beginning and finally collapsed last week .

<ARG0> Ralston Purina Co. </ARG0> <report.01>reported</report.01> <ARG1> a 47 % decline in fourth-quarter earnings </ARG1> , <ARGM-ADV> reflecting restructuring costs as well as a more difficult pet food market </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARG0> The St. Louis company </ARG0> <earn.01>earned</earn.01> <ARG1> $ 45.2 million , or 65 cents a share , </ARG1> <ARGM-ADV> compared with $ 84.9 million , or $ 1.24 a share , a year earlier </ARGM-ADV> .
For <ARG1> the year </ARG1> <end.01>ended</end.01> <ARGM-TMP> Sept. 30 </ARGM-TMP> , Ralston earned $ 422.5 million , or $ 6.44 a share , up 8.9 % from $ 387.8 million , or $ 5.63 a share .
<ARG2> This year 's results </ARG2> <include.01>included</include.01> <ARG1> a gain of $ 70.2 million on the disposal of seafood operations </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Ralston </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> its restructuring costs include the phase-out of a battery facility in Greenville , N.C. , the recent closing of a Hostess cake bakery in Cincinnati and a reduction in staff throughout the company .
The battery plant , which <make.01>makes</make.01> <ARG1> rechargeable nickel cadmium and carbon zinc products </ARG1> , will be closed over the next year or so , a spokesman said .
<ARG0> Ralston </ARG0> <attribute.01>attributed</attribute.01> <ARG1> its fourth-quarter slump </ARG1> <ARGM-DIS> partly </ARGM-DIS> <ARG2-to> to higher costs of ingredients in the pet food business </ARG2-to> as well as competitive pressures , which required higher advertising spending .
<ARG1> For the year , pet food volume was flat </ARG1> , <ARG0> the company </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> .
<ARG0> Its cereal division </ARG0> <realize.02>realized</realize.02> <ARG1> higher operating profit </ARG1> <ARG2-on> on volume increases </ARG2-on> , but also spent more on promotion .
<ARG1> The Continental Baking business </ARG1> <benefit.01>benefited</benefit.01> <ARG0-from> from higher margins on bread and on increased cake sales </ARG0-from> , it added .
<ARG0> Ralston </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> its Eveready battery unit was hurt by continuing economic problems in South America .
<ARG1> Ralston shares </ARG1> <close.02>closed</close.02> <ARGM-TMP> yesterday </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-EXT> at $ 80.50 </ARGM-EXT> , <ARGM-MNR> off $ 1 </ARGM-MNR> , <ARGM-LOC> in New York Stock Exchange composite trading </ARGM-LOC> .
<ARG1> Companies </ARG1> <list.01>listed</list.01> <ARG2> below </ARG2> reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates .
<ARG1> The companies </ARG1> are <follow.02>followed</follow.02> <ARG0-by> by at least three analysts </ARG0-by> , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share .

<ARG0> The percent difference </ARG0> <compare.01>compares</compare.01> <ARG1> actual profit </ARG1> <ARG2-with> with the 30-day estimate </ARG2-with> <ARGM-ADV> where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days </ARGM-ADV> .
<ARGM-DIS> Otherwise </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG1> actual profit </ARG1> is <compare.01>compared</compare.01> <ARG2-with> with the 300-day estimate </ARG2-with> .
<ARG0> First Chicago Corp. </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it completed its $ 55.1 million cash-and-stock acquisition of closely held Ravenswood Financial Corp. , another Chicago bank holding company .
The Soviet purchases are so massive that <ARG0> exporters </ARG0> are <struggle.02>struggling</struggle.02> to find enough river barges and trains to move the recently harvested Midwest crop to ports for loading onto Soviet ships .
<ARG1> River barge rates </ARG1> have <soar.01>soared</soar.01> <ARG2-EXT> 40 % </ARG2-EXT> <ARGM-TMP> this fall </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-TMP> from a year earlier </ARGM-TMP> .
<ARG0> Railroad companies and some ports </ARG0> are <reap.01>reaping</reap.01> <ARG1> a sudden windfall of business </ARG1> .
And <ARG0> some grain analysts </ARG0> are <predict.01>predicting</predict.01> that corn prices might gyrate this month as exporters scrounge to find enough of the crop to meet their obligations to the Soviets .
<ARG0> The Soviet Union </ARG0> <buy.01>bought</buy.01> <ARG1> roughly 310 million bushels of U.S. corn </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> in October </ARGM-TMP> , which is the most ever sold to the Soviet Union in one month from the U.S. .
<ARG0> The Soviet Union </ARG0> <want.01>wants</want.01> <ARG1> much of it delivered by January , which would be a strain in most years </ARG1> .
But it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the Mississippi River , on which <flow.01>flows</flow.01> <ARG1> much of the U.S. corn that is shipped overseas </ARG1> .
`` <ARG0> We </ARG0> are <ship.01>shipping</ship.01> <ARG1> the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record </ARG1> , '' said William Dunton , a U.S. Agriculture Department transportation expert .
`` It is <go.04>going</go.04> to be real tight . ''
Because of persistent dry weather in the northern Plains , the water level on the upper section of the Mississippi River is so low that <ARG0> many river operators </ARG0> are <ARGM-ADV> already </ARGM-ADV> <trim.02>trimming</trim.02> the number of barges their tows push at one time .
In a few weeks , <ARG1> many barges </ARG1> probably wo n't be able to <operate.01>operate</operate.01> <ARGM-MNR> fully loaded </ARGM-MNR> <ARGM-LOC> south of St. Louis </ARGM-LOC> because the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is beginning to reduce the flow of the Missouri River , which feeds into the Mississippi River .
<ARG0> The Army Corps </ARG0> is <cut.02>cutting</cut.02> <ARG1> the flow of the Missouri River </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> about two weeks earlier than normal </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-CAU> because of low water levels in the reservoirs that feed it </ARGM-CAU> .
<ARG1> Barge rates on the Mississippi River </ARG1> <sink.01>sank</sink.01> <ARGM-TMP> yesterday </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-CAU> on speculation that widespread rain this week in the Midwest might temporarily alleviate the situation </ARGM-CAU> .
<ARGM-DIS> But </ARGM-DIS> <ARG0> the Army Corps of Engineers </ARG0> <expect.01>expects</expect.01> <ARG1> the river level to continue falling this month </ARG1> .
<ARGM-LOC> At St. Louis </ARGM-LOC> , the water level of the Mississippi River is already 6.5 feet below normal and <ARG1> it </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> could </ARGM-MOD> <drop.01>drop</drop.01> <ARG2-EXT> an additional 2.5 feet </ARG2-EXT> <ARGM-TMP> when the flow of the Missouri River is slowed </ARGM-TMP> , an Army Corps spokesman said .
<ARG0> Similar levels </ARG0> <hamstring.01>hamstrung</hamstring.01> <ARG1> barge shipments </ARG1> <ARGM-TMP> last year </ARGM-TMP> <ARGM-ADV> in the wake of the worst drought in 50 years </ARGM-ADV> .
So far , the grain industry 's <bud.01>budding</bud.01> <ARG1> logistical problems </ARG1> have n't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade .
<ARG0> Many grain processors and exporters </ARG0> <use.01>use</use.01> <ARG1> the price of the corn futures contracts traded there </ARG1> to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers .
<ARGM-LOC> At the Board of Trade </ARGM-LOC> <ARGM-TMP> yesterday </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> the price of the corn contract for December delivery </ARG1> <slip.01>slipped</slip.01> <ARG2-EXT> 3.5 cents a bushel </ARG2-EXT> <ARGM-ADV> to settle at $ 2.375 a bushel </ARGM-ADV> .
Corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet orders because <ARG0> the harvest </ARG0> has <allow.01>allowed</allow.01> <ARG1> farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988 drought </ARG1> .
With <ARG1> the harvest </ARG1> <wind.04>winding</wind.04> down , however , some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as U.S. exporters try to gather the corn they are obligated to deliver .
<ARG0> Farmers </ARG0> are in the best position of many years to <push.01>push</push.01> <ARG2-DIR> up </ARG2-DIR> <ARG1> corn prices </ARG1> .
Because <ARG0> the drought </ARG0> <reduce.01>reduced</reduce.01> <ARG1> U.S. stockpiles </ARG1> , they have more than enough storage space for their new crop , and that permits them to wait for prices to rise .
<ARGM-LOC> In parts of Iowa </ARGM-LOC> , <ARGM-DIS> for example </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> some grain elevators </ARG0> are <offer.01>offering</offer.01> <ARG3> farmers </ARG3> <ARG2> $ 2.15 a bushel </ARG2> <ARG1-for> for corn </ARG1-for> .
<ARG0> Many farmers </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> probably </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-NEG> n't </ARGM-NEG> <sell.01>sell</sell.01> <ARGM-TMP> until prices rose at least 20 cents a bushel </ARGM-TMP> , said Lyle Reed , president of Chicago Central & Pacific Railroad Co. of Waterloo , Iowa .
It is n't clear , however , <ARG0> who </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <win.01>win</win.01> <ARG1> a waiting game </ARG1> .
Although <ARG1> U.S. corn stockpiles </ARG1> <shrink.01>shrank</shrink.01> <ARG2-by> by roughly half </ARG2-by> <ARGM-TMP> in the wake of the drought </ARGM-TMP> , the Agriculture Department projects that nearly one-fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins .
<ARG0> Some analysts </ARG0> are <worry.01>worried</worry.01> <ARG1> that reports of the grain industry 's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts -- only to see little appreciation </ARG1> .
`` <ARG0> The public </ARG0> is <buy.01>buying</buy.01> <ARG1> the market </ARG1> when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped , '' said Bill Biedermann , Allendale Inc. research director .
Although <ARG1> much of this country 's export corn </ARG1> <go.01>goes</go.01> <ARG4-to> to New Orleans </ARG4-to> <ARGM-MNR> by barge </ARGM-MNR> , it is possible for exporters to sidestep the Mississippi River by shipping a larger-than-normal amount of corn by train to the port .
<ARG0> Ports in the Great Lakes and Atlantic Coast </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> can </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <relieve.01>relieve</relieve.01> <ARG1> pressure on New Orleans </ARG1> .
<ARG0> One railroad </ARG0> , <ARGM-DIS> for example </ARGM-DIS> , is <ARGM-TMP> already </ARGM-TMP> <increase.01>increasing</increase.01> <ARG1> its grain hauling service from Indiana to Baltimore </ARG1> .
And it is n't clear that <ARG1> the Soviet Union </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> will </ARGM-MOD> <stay.01>stay</stay.01> <ARG3-on> on its record buying pace </ARG3-on> .
<ARG1> The Soviet orders </ARG1> were <compress.01>compressed</compress.01> <ARG2-into> into the month of October </ARG2-into> <ARGM-CAU> because of delays </ARGM-CAU> .
<ARG0> The Soviet Union </ARG0> <ARGM-TMP> usually </ARGM-TMP> <begin.01>begins</begin.01> <ARG1> buying U.S. crops earlier in the fall </ARG1> .
But <ARG1> its purchases </ARG1> <ARGM-MOD> apparently </ARGM-MOD> were <delay.01>delayed</delay.01> <ARG0-by> by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems </ARG0-by> .
ENERGY : <ARG1> Crude oil futures prices </ARG1> <increase.01>increased</increase.01> <ARGM-LOC> in moderate trading </ARGM-LOC> , but much of the action was in heating oil .

`` <ARG1> The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities </ARG1> , '' <ARG0> he </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> .
<ARGM-TMP> Yesterday </ARGM-TMP> , <ARG1> the stock market </ARG1> <rise.01>rose</rise.01> <ARG2-MNR> strongly </ARG2-MNR> , <ARGM-ADV> creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders </ARGM-ADV> , he said .
Silver and platinum , which <have.XX>have</have.XX> <ARG1> more of an industrial nature than gold </ARG1> , were even weaker , he said .
<ARG1> Silver is also under pressure of `` extremely high '' inventories in warehouses of the Commodity Exchange </ARG1> , <ARG0> he </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> .

COPPER : <ARG0> Futures prices </ARG0> <ARGM-MNR> partially </ARGM-MNR> <recover.02>recovered</recover.02> <ARG1> Monday 's declines </ARG1> <ARGM-CAU> because Chilean miners voted to strike </ARGM-CAU> .

Reasons for the walkout , <ARG0> the analyst </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> , included a number of procedural issues , such as a right to strike .
<ARG0> The analyst </ARG0> <note.XX>noted</note.XX> <ARG1> that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks </ARG1> .
In the case of copper , <ARG0> he </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> , the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal .
<ARGM-DIS> Also </ARGM-DIS> <contribute.01>contributing</contribute.01> <ARG2-to> to the firmness in copper </ARG2-to> , the analyst noted , was <ARG0> a report by Chicago purchasing agents , which precedes the full purchasing agents ' report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold </ARG0> .

<ARG0> A reading below 50 % </ARG0> <ARGM-ADV> generally </ARGM-ADV> <indicate.01>indicates</indicate.01> <ARG1> a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy </ARG1> , <ARGM-ADV> while a reading above 50 % points to expansion </ARGM-ADV> .

The earnings drop <appear.02>appears</appear.02> particularly steep <ARGM-ADV> in comparison with last year 's unusually strong third quarter , when the company was riding an industrywide boom in demand and pricing </ARGM-ADV> .
However , <ARG1> third-quarter operating profit </ARG1> <fall.01>fell</fall.01> <ARG2-EXT> 14 % </ARG2-EXT> , <ARGM-ADV> as USX sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments , eliminating income from those operations </ARGM-ADV> .

<ARG0> Peter Marcus , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that a downturn in the appliance industry , coupled with sluggish automotive sales , hurt USX results </ARG1> .
<ARG0> The company </ARG0> <attribute.01>attributed</attribute.01> <ARG1> lower sales and earnings for the steel segment </ARG1> <ARG2-to> to the loss of results from the Lorain , Ohio , plant , which now is a 50-50 joint venture with Japan 's Kobe Steel Ltd </ARG2-to> .

<ARG2> The rise in the stock 's price </ARG2> <ARGM-MOD> may </ARGM-MOD> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <reflect.01>reflect</reflect.01> <ARG1> the fact that USX 's steel segment fared better than some other steelmakers ' </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Charles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> USX may have received orders lost by competitors who were involved in labor contracts earlier this year .

<ARG1> Proceeds of that sale </ARG1> are to be <use.01>used</use.01> <ARG2-PNC> to reduce debt and buy back shares </ARG2-PNC> .

<ARG0> Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> any effort by President Bush to claim authority for a line-item veto would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors , as well as the views of previous presidents .
A line-item veto is <ARG0> a procedure that </ARG0> <ARGM-MOD> would </ARGM-MOD> <allow.01>allow</allow.01> <ARG1> a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure </ARG1> .
<ARG0> Mr. Bush </ARG0> has <say.01>said</say.01> he would like to be able to use this procedure .
<ARG0> A White House spokesman </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARGM-TMP> last week </ARGM-TMP> <ARG1> that the president is considering declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line-item veto to provoke a test case </ARG1> .
But <ARG0> the two legal experts </ARG0> , <respond.01>responding</respond.01> <ARG1-to> to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , </ARG1-to> wrote in a joint letter that the president `` lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto . ''
<ARG0> The two professors </ARG0> <represent.01>represent</represent.01> <ARG1> different ends of the political spectrum </ARG1> -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal .
<ARG0> The two professors </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills , not partial measures .
<ARGM-DIS> Moreover </ARGM-DIS> , <ARG0> they </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line-item veto .
<ARG0> They </ARG0> <ARGM-DIS> also </ARGM-DIS> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARG1> that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War </ARG1> , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president .
<ARG0> Sen. Kennedy </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> <ARGM-LOC> in a separate statement </ARGM-LOC> that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power , but that it would be a `` reckless course of action '' for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval .
<ARG0> Trinity Industries Inc. </ARG0> <say.01>said</say.01> it reached a preliminary agreement to sell 500 railcar platforms to Trailer Train Co. of Chicago .
